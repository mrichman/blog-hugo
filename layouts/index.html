        <h3><a href="/services">Why Web Application Performance Matters</a></h3>
        <p>Is your organization able to deliver the best quality and value at the highest speed? Probably not. In fact, <strong>your competitors are likely way ahead of you</strong>. If you're unable to deliver on the following goals, your customers will happily buy elsewhere.</p>
        <h4>Revenue</h4>
        Delays in response time, or even worse - system outages - are proven to result in fewer page views and reduced customer trust. This directly impacts your bottom line. <strong>Every second counts.</strong>
        <h4>Competitive Advantage</h4>
        Simply put, if your application is slower than your competitors', your customers will <strong>buy somewhere else</strong>. Regardless of your product, service, or market, every application is in the customer service business. Your customers need to be happy with every click.
        <h4>Customer Acquisition & Retention</h4>
        Being able to quickly measure customer sentiment - feedback in the marketplace - is crucial in order to attract and retain customers. <strong>How quickly can you collect and report on your key metrics?</strong>
        <h4>Brand Goals</h4>        
        Major performance problems and outages quickly attract negative media attention. Even smaller problems can slowly erode brand value. Customers will become <strong>brand champions</strong> if you outperform their expectations, which keeps them coming back.
