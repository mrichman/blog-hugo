**I create robust standards-based web and mobile applications using HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript.**

&#8220;What about the App Store?!&#8221; you may ask?

Here&#8217;s why I prefer to build HTML5 web apps, instead of an iPhone or iPad native app.

  1. Rapid iteration. If you want a new feature tonight, you get it tonight. No waiting three weeks for you to get through Apple&#8217;s approval process.
  2. It prepares systems for building native apps if you should ever **really** want one. Why? Because apps can include a Safari browser instance inside, so all of this work is reusable.
  3. It’s easier to build and debug because you don’t need to do a lot of specialized coding to make the native app work properly.
  4. Yes, mobile web apps **can** run when disconnected from the web! <a href="http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/SafariJSDatabaseGuide/OfflineApplicationCache/OfflineApplicationCache.html" target="_blank">Read more&#8230;</a>
  5. Another benefit to HTML5 that is that your app will also run on millions of other smartphones out there, like the <a href="http://news.softpedia.com/news/Android-2-0-Available-Today-Android-2-1-Next-126330.shtml" target="_blank">Droid</a> and the <a href="http://mypre.com/palm-pre-gets-html5-google-maps-app-offline-webapps-200918613/" target="_blank">Pre</a> &#8211; instead of just on the iPhone.
