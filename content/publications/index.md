### Hosting Provider Achieves Fourfold Gain in Developer Productivity, Threefold Increase in Scalability {#hosting-provider-achieves-fourfold-gain-in-developer-productivity-threefold-increase-in-scalability}

Microsoft Visual Studio 2005 Customer Case Study

> By switching to ASP.NET 2.0, we were able to implement the required functionality more than twice as fast with one-third the resources as compared with PHP. – I made a few enemies in the PHP community with this one!

#### Book Overview {#book-overview}

Web Services are self-describing, modular applications. The Web Services architecture can be thought of as a wrapper for the application code. This wrapper provides standardized means of: describing the Web Service and what it does; publishing it to a registry, so that it can easily be located; and exposing an interface, so that the service can be invoked – all in a machine-readable format. What is particularly compelling about Web Services is that any client that understands XML, regardless of platform, language and object model, can access them.

This book provides a snapshot of the current state of these rapidly evolving technologies, beginning by detailing the main protocols that underpin the Web Services model (SOAP, WSDL, and UDDI), and then putting this theory to practical use in a wide array of popular toolkits, platforms, and development environments.

The technologies presented in this book provide the foundations of Web Services computing, which is set to revolutionize Distributed Computing, as we know it.

#### Who is this book for? {#who-is-this-book-for}

This book is for developers wanting to learn what web services are, and how to create, register, and deploy them. In teaching the core technologies, we assume knowledge of XML from the outset.

### Web Services Security Using Pluggable Providers {#web-services-security-using-pluggable-providers}

> The web services model is rapidly growing as an option for deploying reusable, component-based functionality over the internet. Exposing these services is the Simple Object Access Protocol, which defines a lightweight mechanism for invoking these services or transactions.
