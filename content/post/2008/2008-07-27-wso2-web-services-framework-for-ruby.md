I&#8217;ve been looking forward to this since I started working with Ruby and Rails. As a long time SOAP expert, I was disappointed by soap4r and the obvious absence of WS-* imeplementations in the Ruby world. Now, it looks like I can finally start abandoning WCF and get down to some serious productivity.

<a target="_blank" href="http://wso2.org/projects/wsf/ruby">WSO2 Web Services Framework for Ruby</a> (WSO2 WSF/Ruby), is an open source, enterprise grade, Ruby extension for providing and consuming Web Services in Ruby.

WSO2 WSF/Ruby is a complete solution for building and deploying Web services, and is the only Ruby extension with the widest range of WS-* specification implementations. Key features include, secure services and clients with WS-Security support, binary attachments with MTOM, works with Ruby on Rails and interoperability with .NET and J2EE.
