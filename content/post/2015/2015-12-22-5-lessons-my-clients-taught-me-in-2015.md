I&#8217;ve had the privilege to help organizations grow, transform, and improve. Along the way, my clients have taught me some valuable lessons that shape how I work. You can&#8217;t stop learning when you view everyone you meet as a teacher.

### Change is Hard

I have worked with a wide variety of client personality types over the years; some are excited, motivated and proactive about change. Others can be insecure, anxious, or apprehensive. All have had at least a short period of discomfort as they changed their mindsets and routines to a new way of doing things. Learning new skills, behaviors, tools, and processes can take from a few weeks to a year, depending on the client. Keeping these realities in mind, it is my job to support my clients through change.

### Never Stop Learning

My clients endeavor to understand more about the technology landscape. It always amazes me when a client repeats back something I taught them, even after I&#8217;ve long forgotten what I said. Ultimately, much of my learning is done while I work with my clients and their teams. I learn from every experience and interaction, and apply that knowledge to future projects. I embrace these challenges, focusing on my passions, and I have fun!

### Share Success

I genuinely care about my clients, and I&#8217;m excited about my consulting, coaching, training, and speaking opportunities. I&#8217;m just as elated as my clients when we successfully achieve our goals. Even when the going might get tough, clients are motivated by a consistently reliable, knowledgeable consultant who loves what they do and is as committed to success as they are to their long term relationship with the client.

### Be Flexible

Project focus and direction can change on a dime and so can your clients&#8217; strategy and objectives. You need to be ready to shift gears and adjust quickly to changes within the organizations that you work with.

### Friendships are not Bounded by Age

My peer group had always been +/- 3 years. Now I&#8217;ve got friends 40 years older and 15 years younger, directly as a result of those with whom I work.

### The Brown hair isn&#8217;t Coming Back

The arrow of time only points in one direction. Okay, I guess that&#8217;s six things. Must be the old age.
