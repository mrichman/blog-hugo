The Jewish New Year is a time focused on introspection, looking back at the mistakes of the past year and planning the positive changes to make in year ahead. Whether you share the same calendar that I do, please accept my wishes for health, happiness, life and peace in the weeks and months ahead.

Happy New Year!
