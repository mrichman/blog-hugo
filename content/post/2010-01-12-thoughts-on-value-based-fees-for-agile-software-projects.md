Here&#8217;s a quandary &#8211; we, as value-based IT consultants, aspire to charge value-based fees for our services (how obvious!). We know that doing so requires tight scope control. As such, this often requires a detailed specification. However, this is the very <a title="Waterfall Model" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model" target="_blank">waterfall model</a> that the <a title="Agile Software Development" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development" target="_blank">agile movement</a> shuns. How do you reconcile <a title="Scope Creep" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep" target="_blank">scope control</a>, customer satisfaction, and ever-changing requirements with value-based fees? I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s preferable &#8211; or practical &#8211; to do two week iterations on a value-based fee basis. Just as much as value-based fees benefit the client by not requiring them to make an investment decision every time they wish to engage you, they also may trap the consultant into having a value discussion/negotiation with the client for each iteration. Thoughts?
