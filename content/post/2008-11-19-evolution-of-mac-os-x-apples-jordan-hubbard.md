Apple&#8217;s Director of Engineering of Unix Technologies Jordan Hubbard spoke at [LISA &#8217;08][1] last week. LISA (or Large Installation System Administration Conference) is a technical conference targeted at engineers and system administrators. This year&#8217;s conference [invited][2] Apple&#8217;s Jordan Hubbard to speak about the evolution of Mac OS X from large servers to embedded platforms. While technical readers may find the content of Hubbard&#8217;s [presentation slides (PDF)][3] quite interesting, the most surprising revelation is a more specific target date for Apple&#8217;s Mac OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard): 1st Quarter 2009.
