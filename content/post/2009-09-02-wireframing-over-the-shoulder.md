In the process of creating Obox Signature Series Themes, David had to create a shopping cart system (custom built&#8230; why? we dont know), so that involved a design.

But before David could design it, he had to visualise this beast in his head and get it onto paper. So since he loves wireframing so much, and talks about it often, he decided to film the whole process from start to finish.

What you see in this episode is David drawing the wireframes from scratch (its been fastforwarded so dont worry).
