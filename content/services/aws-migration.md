I can help you transform your business and deliver high-performing applications, faster and more economically than with on-premises solutions. My Amazon Web Services (AWS) migration services include: strategy and roadmap, infrastructure audit, architecture design, automation, deployment, testing, cutover and disaster recovery planning.

Migrating a single application to AWS can seem simple. Sometimes it is. But more often, that applicationâ€™s function is tied to multiple business processes and dependencies. It may impact your vendors, your balance sheet, your regulatory compliance.

Moreover, a simple "forklift" approach to moving your applications to the cloud often bypasses the key benefits associated with the cloud: cost savings, scalability, increased speed and flexibility.

When you're contemplating a cloud migration of 100 or 1,000 applications, the missed opportunities and potential pitfalls can pile up.

AWS migrations involve a very complex set of distributed activities that need to be managed deliberately and with agility. I will work with you to rapidly map applications and infrastructure as well as to determine the right migration path.

## Amazon Web Services (AWS) Migration Planning 

Here's what you get:

1. An initial in-depth, one-on-one remote meeting with me to define long-term business goals, existing legacy systems architecture, and organizational challenges.
2. A thorough analysis of your current infrastructure, including any architecturally significant use cases, as they may relate to AWS.
3. I will provide a custom report and roadmap, detailing the specific migration path from your on-premises solution to AWS, step-by-step. This will include complete specifications for compute resources, storage, databases, networking, security, usage fees, and any other necessary "moving parts" to get you up and running on AWS.
4. A closing phone or Skype call to go over the results and reports, talk about your strategy again and make sure that we have everything covered.
5. I can optionally present a separate proposal to personally implement the migration plan with you and your staff.

My one-time fee for AWS Migration Planning is $4,500 USD.
