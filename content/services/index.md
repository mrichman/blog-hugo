### Cloud Strategy Retainer

Cloud-based applications are not simply “forklifted” versions of their on-premises cousins; in fact, cloud application platforms are far more sophisticated.

Learning things the hard way in the cloud means wasting tens (or sometimes hundreds) of thousands of dollars on misguided development efforts. Worse, you risk losing valuable competitive advantage by prolonging your time to market. Our consulting engagement will give you access to the strategic and tactical cloud expertise you need, when you need it. [Learn More](/services/strategy-retainer)
