  During Word War II, the US Office of War Information coined the phrase “Loose Lips Sink Ships” in an effort to mitigate the risk of leaking information to enemy spies. While this tactic is useful during wartime, it can serve to hurt your business. What I mean here is sinking your ship from within by failing to communicate, both early and often. One of my best clients is a government contractor, providing software systems to to the US military.

  For 37 million adulterers, this was a very bad week. Ashley Madison, a website catering to those seeking extramarital affairs, had its database of users hacked. Putting aside the ethical and moral issues surrounding Ashley Madison, this event gives us an opportunity to analyze the current state of cybersecurity. What makes this case noteworthy are the following: The attack was ideological in nature, as opposed to most other hacks which are directed to either cause mischief and disruption, or to obtain credit card and other sensitive data.

  Failing at employee retention, especially in high tech, can be devastating to your business. Protect your investment by keeping your top talent from jumping ship. Overcommunicate Employees want to feel involved. Executives should regularly communicate with employees. And I don’t mean an annual conference call with an 80-slide PowerPoint to discuss results. When I managed teams, I made calendar time for one-on-one informal chats with my staff. Even if it was just over coffee, I needed to “take their temperature”.

  I was recently working with a consulting client who was suffering from a productivity decline in her organization over the past year. My client, a VP of a software development organization, recently adopted Scrum as its Agile software development process. When I conducted interviews with key team members, a common complaint emerged: “Management is always ignoring the process!” Most organizations follow some form of process, regardless of the domain. These processes range from lightweight (almost nonexistent) to the draconian.

  I just bought a new home. Well, new to me anyway. I need to have the entire interior repainted from its current shade of canary yellow to something more&#8230;civilized. So, I’ve been auditioning painting contractors. I figured three competitive estimates would net me something workable. I solicited referrals from friends and colleagues, and even took to Angie’s List for a highly reviewed local company. I gave two a call, and surprisingly, both were available the same day to provide written estimates.

  When I meet with clients for the first time, they often present me with a project concept and requirements already defined. Measures of success are usually loose or absent, but a firm deadline is common. The client often jumps right to cost, scope, or some other set of variables they believe are of primary importance. Here I hit the brakes, and work with the client to discover the real problem the project is trying to solve.

  In 2010, Esther Derby wrote, “How agile you are doesn’t matter. Whether you are 50 per cent agile, 90 per cent agile or agile through and through (what ever that means), doesn’t matter. What does matter is that your company is satisfying its customers, stakeholders, and employees.” While it’s critical to satisfy those groups in order to keep the lights on, you can’t reach the next level of performance in your business by simply remaining afloat.

  Alignment occurs when leaders and teams share the same values and work towards a common goal. Autonomy allows teams to work independently of leaders and each other. The stronger alignment we have, the more autonomy we can afford to grant. The leader’s job is to communicate what problem needs to be solved, and why. The team’s job is to collaborate with each other to find the best solution. &nbsp;

  What are the top ways in which organizations fail to adopt or fully implement Scrum and/or Agile? &#8220;It is difficult to get a person to understand something, when their salary depends on not understanding it.&#8221; &#8211; Upton Sinclair First, let’s address the question. Agile is not something that we can implement, it is a characteristic that we try to achieve. So, we do not “do agile”, we practice techniques that help us become agile; that give us the ability to move gracefully and help us become adaptable and resourceful.
