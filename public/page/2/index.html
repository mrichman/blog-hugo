  One of my best clients initially contacted me because they simply wanted to get faster at what they do. They needed to deliver more value to their customers more often, and at lower cost. However, they just couldn&#8217;t seem to improve. When I paid them a visit, I looked at their product development lifecycle as a whole. Their product roadmap was solid, their requirements specifications and test plans were clear, the team had all the right skills, and their quality was high.

  With the end of the year fast approaching, my clients are now focusing like a laser what they would like to accomplish in 2016. Many are finalizing their technology strategy, investing in DevOps practices and tools, committing to Agile transformation, and leveraging the Cloud. All these efforts enable my clients to do two things they couldn&#8217;t before: fail fast and pivot. What do we mean by fail fast? When developing new solutions with my clients, we embrace a feedback loop.

  Many years ago, I subcontracted on a large software project. It was an automotive warranty claims processing system. Many consultants had cycled through this organization over 3 or 4 years, none ever seeming to make a dent towards completing the project. I personally spent eighteen months on this project. Rumor has it that almost $30 million was ultimately spent, with little to show for it. Yes, you read that correctly. How do unproductive projects fester like this for so long, and with such expense?

  I&#8217;ve worked with dozens of organizations and teams making the transition to Agile &#8211; specifically Scrum. The same issues constantly arise, almost always around testing. According to Scrum, a Product Backlog Item (PBI) is never done until it is potentially shippable. That means code complete, tested, and documented, with a pretty bow on top&#8230;it&#8217;s not just done, it&#8217;s done done. Because we work in a timebox &#8211; the Sprint &#8211; we have a hard date from which to work backwards, usually two weeks.

  Imagine a typical week of traffic to your company&#8217;s web store. This pattern might look a lot like your own traffic, with a peak during the middle of the day, and a slowdown in the middle of the night. Given this pattern, it becomes really easy to do capacity planning. We can provision, say 15% over what we see our normal peak to be, and be happy with the capacity we have for a while, so long as our traffic matches this pattern.

  People hate change. We have our habits, routines, and preferences that drive us to act, or in many cases fail to act. When I engage with a new client, I spend a lot of time not only understanding their business processes, but also the rationale for those processes. It&#8217;s my job to question and challenge these processes, with the goal of improving (or even removing) them to create new value for my clients.

  John Wayne airport in Santa Ana, California has a rather unique set of takeoff requirements. Its runway, at 5,701 feet, is one of the shortest among commercial airports in the US. A Boeing 757 is the largest airplane that can be accommodated. It also has very strict noise requirements. My cousin lives next door in quiet Irvine, and told me that airplanes must take off at full throttle, shooting off the runway like a rocket, then quickly back down the engines to keep quiet.

  Microsoft sucks. Java is dead. Rails can&#8217;t scale. Python is slow. I&#8217;ve heard it all, and I can tell you none of it matters. Developers are an interesting breed; they tend to stick to what they know best, but also love to tinker with new technologies. These experiments often fail at the expense of a project&#8217;s success, however. Many of my clients struggle with technology choice for new projects. Business owners and executives are hesitant to try newer technologies, but by the same token don&#8217;t want to be left driving an Edsel.

  Software is a means to an end, not an end in and of itself. My long-time client, a general contractor, called me this weekend with a “great idea” for some custom cloud-based software that will transform his business. I get calls like this all the time; these requests usually go something like this: Client is in pain Build a new software system No more pain Profit! This is cloudy thinking. I asked my client about his real objectives, and he started rattling off requirements for this piece of magic software.
