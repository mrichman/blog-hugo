  Now that we’re in Q4, your technology strategy for 2016 should be well formed. So what’s your plan for SCAM? The Social, Cloud, Analytics, and Mobile (SCAM) stack presents a framework in which organizations can align marketing and technical efforts with a customer-centric strategy. Social Media is the New CRM People have an innate need for affiliation. We join clubs, professional associations, play sports, and even practice our religions, to one degree or another, in order to satisfy this need.

  The role of CIO as Chief Infrastructure Officer is becoming increasingly irrelevant. IT budgets have shifted to Marketing. Corporate infrastructure is moving to the cloud. So what&#8217;s left? Data. Enter the Chief Data Officer Data belongs to the business, not just to IT. The CDO represents these business interests. If the CIO&#8217;s job is simply to keep the lights on, that&#8217;s not something the rest of the business will relate to.

  I&#8217;ve been working with my best clients on integrating realtime Voice of the Customer (VoC) technologies into their e-commerce operations. The results have been enlightening and profitable! When I first started with e-commerce systems around 2003, the industry was still in its infancy, and many customers still followed up online orders with multiple confirmation phone calls, or would use a vendor&#8217;s website to get their phone number to place an order.

  This past Sunday around 6am ET, Amazon Web Services had a mega outage, affecting millions of customers worldwide. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon&#8217;s global cloud computing infrastructure business unit. AWS powers many popular websites including Netflix, Pinterest, Expedia, IMDB, Reddit, and more. Many of my own clients rely on AWS services. Multiple AWS systems failed simultaneously: DynamoDB, Cognito, and CloudWatch. The latter, CloudWatch, is Amazon&#8217;s own cloud monitoring platform. So, the system used to monitor their own cloud went offline, unable to alert on its offline status.

  In my previous article, we examined the business drivers for a cloud migration. Next, let’s look at some strategies for success, and some common challenges when moving and IT organization to the cloud. There isn’t just one path to the cloud. When planning migrations with my clients, I present a number of proven options, with a focus on not only minimizing downtime, but also a path to growth. Most migration plans fall into one of three categories: Forklift, Refactor, or Rebuild.

  My best clients have been migrating their on-premise line-of-business applications to the cloud, with varying degrees of adoption. In the coming series of articles, I’ll explain some of the business drivers for this transition, high-level technical considerations, and challenges for the organization. Part One: Business Drivers for Change All organizations are under increasing pressure to maximize their return on technology investment. As budgets shift funds from IT to marketing, the IT organization seeks to save costs.

  Whether you’re an established business looking to raise the bar, or a startup delivering new technology to market, you need expert knowledge and experience to advise you. In this article, I’m going to discuss what a technology advisor does, and how you’ll be far better off working with one. Who works with a technology advisor? Business owners and technology executives need to make quick but informed decisions. Top line revenue growth, and bottom line profit are key drivers.

  While a steadily growing number of organizations have been moving their resources offshore, it still remains an involved, high-risk decision. Most companies consider moving at least some of their workload offshore for cost reduction and “follow the sun” coverage for support staff. I’ve worked with companies of all sizes to integrate offshore teams, and what I’ve found interesting is the common challenges they have. Most notably, they cite while labor costs are lower, product quality decreases, and projects take longer to complete.

  I spend a lot of time working with clients on developing their Agile software development processes. These clients are usually CEOs and senior executives who need to deliver better software faster, cheaper, with higher quality and lower risk. Unfortunately, risk avoidance can result in delaying critical decision-making. When this risk aversion becomes debilitating, we have Analysis Paralysis. Effective business leaders have clear plans and take action. However, we are constantly flooded with new ideas, alternatives, and endless potential risks.

  In 2011, Gartner predicted that CMOs would outspend CIOs by 2017. All signs continue to point to this reality, and the shift has created rifts between marketing and technology leaders. So, how do we avoid turf wars when it comes to marketing technology? One of my best clients is a marketing executive at a medium-sized e-commerce company, who needed my help in selecting a vendor for her email marketing automation initiative.
