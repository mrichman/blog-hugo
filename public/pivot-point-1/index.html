  <h1>Pivot Point #1</h1>
  <h2></h2>

<div class="content">
  <p>This past weekend, I was talking to a CEO friend of mine in the mail-order cosmetics industry. She has not yet fully embraced e-commerce, as the direct-mail channel is her bread and butter. She claimed to want to expand her business into the online channel, but didn&#8217;t think it fit her traditional demographic. She&#8217;s been selling to women fifty and older for over 20 years. I went on to explain that she needs to embrace a new demographic &#8211; even multiple demographics &#8211; across multiple channels in order to grow her business. I explained, &#8220;Continuing to do what made you successful in the past could put you out of business in the future.&#8221; She agreed with a sigh and I am now working with her to create an online strategy to expand her customer base, and increase her revenue.</p>

<p>The moral of the story here is that change is difficult and stressful, but if you don&#8217;t embrace change, you will ultimately become irrelevant.</p>

<p>We can see this phenomenon with even the largest, most successful corporations. Microsoft recently announced that Satya Nadella will be their new CEO. Nadella is a 22-year Microsoft veteran with no experience running a company as complex as this one. I have my doubts that he will be able to revive Microsoft&#8217;s once exciting customer-focused strategy, much less execute on it. This was a highly conservative and safe choice. Nadella is a Microsoft insider, and it&#8217;s reasonable to assume he will continue to do things the &#8220;Microsoft&#8221; way. The fact that Bill Gates is stepping down (ousted?) as Chairman to &#8220;take a more active role&#8221; supports this, in my opinion. Therein lies their ultimate path to irrelevance: Microsoft lost the tablet war before it even started, continues to lose desktop market share to Apple, and never got off the line with their mobile offerings.</p>

<p>In order to avoid irrelevance, Microsoft has to do something incredibly disruptive. <strong>What are you doing in your business efforts to remain relevant, grow, and flourish?</strong></p>
