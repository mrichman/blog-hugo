  <h1>Welcome to the Republican Party</h1>
  <h2></h2>
</div>
<div class="content">
  <p>A young woman was about to finish her first year of college. Like so many others her age, she considered herself to be a very liberal Democrat, and among other liberal ideals, was very much in favor of higher taxes to support more government programs, in other words, redistribution of wealth.</p>

<p>She was deeply ashamed that her father was a rather staunch Republican, a feeling she openly expressed. Based on the lectures that she had participated in, and the occasional chat with a professor, she felt that her father had for years harbored an evil, selfish desire to keep what he thought should be his.</p>

<p>One day she was challenging her father on his opposition to higher taxes on the rich and the need for more government programs. The self-professed objectivity proclaimed by her professors had to be the truth and she indicated so to her father. He responded by asking how she was doing in school.</p>

<p>Taken aback, she answered rather haughtily that she had a 4.0 GPA, and let him know that it was tough to maintain, insisting that she was taking a very difficult course load and was constantly studying, which left her no time to go out and party like other people she knew. She didn&#8217;t even have time for a</p>

<p>boyfriend, and didn&#8217;t really have many college friends because she spent all her time studying.</p>

<p>Her father listened and then asked, &#8216;How is your friend Audrey doing?&#8217;</p>

<p>She replied, &#8216;Audrey is barely getting by. All she takes are easy classes, she never studies, and she barely has a 2.0 GPA. She is so popular on campus; college for her is a blast. She&#8217;s always invited to all the parties and lots of times she doesn&#8217;t even show up for classes because she&#8217;s too hung over.&#8217;</p>

<p>Her wise father asked his daughter, &#8216;Why don&#8217;t you go to the Dean&#8217;s office and ask him to deduct 1.0 off your GPA and give it to your friend who only has a 2.0. That way you will both have a 3.0 GPA and certainly that would be a fair and equal distribution of GPA.&#8217;</p>

<p>The daughter, visibly shocked by her father&#8217;s suggestion, angrily fired back,</p>

<p>&#8216;That&#8217;s a crazy idea, how would that be fair! I&#8217;ve worked really hard for my grades! I&#8217;ve invested a lot of time, and a lot of hard work! Audrey has done next to nothing toward her degree. She played while I worked my tail off!&#8217;</p>

<p>The father slowly smiled, winked and said gently, &#8216;Welcome to the Republican Party.&#8217;</p>
