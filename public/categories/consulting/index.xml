      <description>

&lt;p&gt;My clients, just like you, want to enable faster, better delivery of value. I&amp;#8217;ve helped these organizations scale and improve their operations through agile delivery, achieving continuous innovation of their products. I write and speak a lot about the people, processes, tools, and technologies required for success with agile. While people and processes are critical for success, I want to switch gears a bit talk about tools and technologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The pace of application innovation is faster than ever before, requiring Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD). Container technologies, such as &lt;strong&gt;Docker&lt;/strong&gt;, deliver a robust mechanism to develop and deploy applications faster, cheaper, and with higher quality than ever before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-is-it&#34;&gt;What is it?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast to virtual machines, containers offer minimal overhead and resource usage. Developers, testers, and system administrators can quickly run an entire production stack locally, without having to configure and maintain multiple VMs. But that&amp;#8217;s just one use case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are some benefits my clients enjoy by using Docker:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Simplified configuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More efficient management of CI and CD pipelines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Improved developer and tester productivity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Application isolation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Server consolidation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Faster development and debugging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multitenancy without virtual machines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Rapid deployment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On average, companies that use Docker &lt;strong&gt;ship software 7x more often&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-does-it-all-work&#34;&gt;How does it all work?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Each container instance includes the application, and a minimum set of OS components needed to run, thereby enabling lightweight, composable, and portable applications. In effect, containers unlock a write-once, run anywhere approach. Developers can target application deployment to any location, without having to rewrite or reconfigure code, thereby maximizing productivity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-932 align left alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/what-is-docker-diagram-273x300.png&#34; alt=&#34;what-is-docker-diagram&#34; width=&#34;273&#34; height=&#34;300&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/what-is-docker-diagram-273x300.png 273w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/what-is-docker-diagram.png 638w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 273px) 100vw, 273px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  We achieve this level of performance through a deliberate architecture shift to microservices. These are small, independent application components, built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment machinery.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One efficiency killer I see time and again is an inflexible, monolithic application architecture. These are applications that have grown over time, improperly curated, that are difficult to maintain and keep pace with innovation. Making the shift to microservices makes not only simplifies maintenance, but allows an easy path to containerization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Docker helps maximize developer productivity by eliminating dependencies across application services. Applications, once decomposed into microservices, can be deployed to different containers. These containers operate in isolation, so dependencies on conflicting versions are eliminated. The microservices can be independently upgraded, allowing for rapid innovation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-i-can-help-you&#34;&gt;How I can help you&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mission is to help your company achieve maximum performance through agile development and cloud computing. Whether it&amp;#8217;s a culture shift, readying your people and processes for agile, or implementing the tools and technologies to realize DevOps success, we can find opportunities for improvement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>3 Ways to Build an Agile Organization</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/3-ways-to-build-an-agile-organization/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 29 Dec 2015 12:55:10 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/3-ways-to-build-an-agile-organization/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-919 alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/orgift-featured-300x138.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;138&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/orgift-featured-300x138.jpg 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/orgift-featured.jpg 630w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;For the last few years, especially in the software development space, we&amp;#8217;ve been hearing the word &amp;#8220;agile&amp;#8221; thrown around ad nauseam. Concepts such as iterative design, adaptive planning, collaboration, self-organization, continuous delivery, and so on flood the current literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent the last several years working with clients to develop and improve their agile practices, improving quality and time-to-market. The result has been great for software teams and customers alike. But aren&amp;#8217;t we leaving the rest of the organization out in the cold? How can we apply these practices beyond software development, improving the business from the top down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;em&gt;Agile Organization&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small companies, like the startups with whom I&amp;#8217;ve been involved, embrace agility as their default. Larger, more established companies, tend to move less nimbly as they grow, exposing themselves to disruption by more agile players. Let&amp;#8217;s look at a few strategies to help us achieve agility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speeding Adoption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my clients have been struggling to implement agile practices throughout their organization, often taking a couple of years to apply it to every program and project. This kind of _variable adoption_ often indicates a lack of commitment to change. With parts of the organization operating at different cadences, tremendous friction develops, stalling progress. I&amp;#8217;ve worked with diehards, skeptics, and even saboteurs to make agile a reality. Speeding up the agile adoption process in the face of naysayers requires a leap of faith, but one that is supported by years of supporting evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone is a Leader&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the secret weapons of Agile&amp;#8217;s success is the role of the individual contributor. Innovators, specialists, and organizers all have equal influence. There is no place for a hands-off manager sitting behind a desk in an agile organization. In some of the best performing organizations with whom I&amp;#8217;ve worked, the teams often assign deliverables to executives, and not the other way around. Steve Jobs once said, &amp;#8220;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5;&#34;&gt;it doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.&amp;#8221; The agile organization is a collective; trust in each of your people to take a leadership role.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decide Fast, Fail Faster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agile organizations make decisions quickly. This is not to be confused with unmitigated risk-taking. I&amp;#8217;ve seen companies grind to a halt under the strain of &lt;em&gt;analysis paralysis&lt;/em&gt;, forestalling critical decisions due to perceived risk. Longer development cycles increase this risk substantially. I work with my clients to shorten these cycle times. With smaller, more frequent deliveries to market, we can inspect, analyze, and adapt to change. If we fail, by whatever metric we choose, we can take advantage of the learning to improve our decision making and recover quickly. This is the iterative nature of agile, and therein lies its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenge Questions for Business Leaders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have a stalled agile adoption in your organization, or varying rates of adoption?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you empowered everyone at all levels to be a decision maker?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you missing market opportunities due to stalled decisions or slow production cycles?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Lessons My Clients Taught Me in 2015</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-911 alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/project-lessons-learned-300x208.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;project-lessons-learned&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;208&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/project-lessons-learned-300x208.jpg 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/project-lessons-learned.jpg 620w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;Another year in the books. I&amp;#8217;ve had the privilege to help organizations grow, transform, and improve. Along the way, my clients have taught me some valuable lessons that shape how I work. You can&amp;#8217;t stop learning when you view everyone you meet as a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;change-is-hard&#34;&gt;Change is Hard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked with a wide variety of client personality types over the years; some are excited, motivated and proactive about change. Others can be insecure, anxious, or apprehensive. All have had at least a short period of discomfort as they changed their mindsets and routines to a new way of doing things. Learning new skills, behaviors, tools, and processes can take from a few weeks to a year, depending on the client. Keeping these realities in mind, it is my job to support my clients through change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;never-stop-learning&#34;&gt;Never Stop Learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My clients endeavor to understand more about the technology landscape. It always amazes me when a client repeats back something I taught them, even after I&amp;#8217;ve long forgotten what I said. Ultimately, much of my learning is done while I work with my clients and their teams. I learn from every experience and interaction, and apply that knowledge to future projects. I embrace these challenges, focusing on my passions, and I have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;share-success&#34;&gt;Share Success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely care about my clients, and I&amp;#8217;m excited about my consulting, coaching, training, and speaking opportunities. I&amp;#8217;m just as elated as my clients when we successfully achieve our goals. Even when the going might get tough, clients are motivated by a consistently reliable, knowledgeable consultant who loves what they do and is as committed to success as they are to their long term relationship with the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;be-flexible&#34;&gt;Be Flexible&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project focus and direction can change on a dime and so can your clients&amp;#8217; strategy and objectives. You need to be ready to shift gears and adjust quickly to changes within the organizations that you work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;friendships-are-not-bounded-by-age&#34;&gt;Friendships are not Bounded by Age&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My peer group had always been +/- 3 years. Now I&amp;#8217;ve got friends 40 years older and 15 years younger, directly as a result of those with whom I work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-brown-hair-isn-8217-t-coming-back&#34;&gt;The Brown hair isn&amp;#8217;t Coming Back&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrow of time only points in one direction. Okay, I guess that&amp;#8217;s six things. Must be the old age.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Gunfighting and IT Service Delivery</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/gunfighting-and-it-service-delivery/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 14 Dec 2015 16:41:48 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/gunfighting-and-it-service-delivery/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-893 alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/eastwood-300x165.png&#34; alt=&#34;eastwood&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;165&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/eastwood-300x165.png 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/eastwood-768x421.png 768w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/eastwood-1024x562.png 1024w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/eastwood.png 1485w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been a sport shooting enthusiast for about 15 years. In that time, I&amp;#8217;ve found the most difficult skill to master is &lt;strong&gt;speed vs. accuracy&lt;/strong&gt;. In a fight for one&amp;#8217;s life, this skill becomes vital &amp;#8211; hitting the right target before you exhaust your ammunition. This same balance applies to IT service delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my consulting work, I&amp;#8217;ve observed clients who have only one speed. Some clients can only deliver quickly, others slowly. Both extremes are dangerous. Whichever speed it is, it will only be optimal for a narrow range of projects. Learning to adapt and adjust speed is critical for success &amp;#8211; that is, hitting the right target at the right speed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we know how fast to go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to my gunfighting analogy &amp;#8211; as the distance to your target increases, so do your chances of missing. Counterintuitively, sometimes you have to speed up to gain accuracy, closing the distance to your target.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What does this have to do with IT service delivery?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glad you asked. I&amp;#8217;ve had clients work at both speed extremes. Too quickly, and requirements are missed, bugs abound, and expensive rework is incurred. As a result, important features get dropped to make a delivery date, or worse, dates are missed. Too slowly, and (obviously) dates are missed, but more importantly, competitors can leapfrog you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you just said to speed up to gain accuracy. Mark, you&amp;#8217;re pulling my leg!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nope. I promise. What I mean by &amp;#8220;speed&amp;#8221; here is not necessarily how quickly you can deliver, but how &lt;strong&gt;frequently&lt;/strong&gt; you can deliver.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequency, by way of iteration, allows us to deliver just the right solution at the right time, and no more. Delivering with shorter iterations reduces the distance to our target, and allows us to quickly adapt based on customer demand, market forces, or to take advantage of new technologies. Iterating also allows us to minimize the amount of waste produced by rework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mark, how fast can I go?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t know. You don&amp;#8217;t know. But we can find out. After adopting some agile practices, we can measure our velocity &amp;#8211; the amount of value we can deliver per iteration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re anything like my clients, you&amp;#8217;ll be surprised to learn how much faster and straighter you can shoot.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Five Must-Answer Tech Strategy Questions</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/five-must-answer-tech-strategy-questions/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2015 20:31:48 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/five-must-answer-tech-strategy-questions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;​Many of my senior-executive clients have been called upon by their boards to get directly involved in technology issues. These boards are also starting to think strategically about technology, and how industry trends are shaping their companies&amp;#8217; future. More than ever, we need to ask questions that keep us focused on the right issues. While working with clients on new projects, or meeting prospective clients for the first time, I&amp;#8217;ve collected a series of &amp;#8220;must-answer&amp;#8221; questions that bring clarity to any technology strategy initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often does your board discuss technology topics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my clients lament that technology-specific topics are raised, on average, only twice a year at the board level. This level of strategic attention to technology isn&amp;#8217;t just insufficient, it&amp;#8217;s negligent. Boards as well as executive teams must consider the competitive landscape, keeping their eye on not only well-known competitors, but more importantly, from emerging competitors with distruptive technologies. I encourage frequent (at least quarterly) discussions to help keep the focus on competitveness, lest my clients face decimation by a more nible innovator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What technology-related issues are addressed by your leadership?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, most executive teams relegate their technology discussions to the usual Keeping the Lights On (KTLO) issues. These are tasks such as application maintenance, change requests, standard updates, and general systems maintenance. This is at least a $1 Trillion travesty and upwards of 80% of my clients&amp;#8217; IT budgets are spent on KTLO. I help my clients elevate the importance of technology in their organizations from that of a commoditized utility to a strategic value-center. Thinking about that big data or cloud deployment, but you&amp;#8217;ve got KTLO issues? Don&amp;#8217;t do it without talking to me first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a technologist on your board? How does their presence affect the focus on technology issues?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#8217;t, you&amp;#8217;re endangering your business. Meaningful technology discussions at the board level are impossible without a technology-literate membership. I&amp;#8217;m not suggesting your CIO or CTO become board members, but I do advocate technology literacy at the board level. I&amp;#8217;ve worked with clients to develop &amp;#8220;tech strategy boot camps&amp;#8221; to achieve literacy in common issues such as data security, agile product management, big data, cloud, and other topics that board members of technology organizations should be conversant in. While this doesn&amp;#8217;t automatically turn novices into experts, it does offer an opportunity to become familiar with core issues affecting business strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What experience do our customers expect, and how can we better delight them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work with a number of e-commerce clients. They all face constant pressure from the likes of Apple, Amazon, and others to provide an insanely convenient and personal experience. Competing with these retail juggernauts, expecting to beat them at their own game is quixotic. Instead, we create disruptive programs to delight customers through innovative approaches to convenience and service. More traditional companies, such as banks, are deepening their investments in big data and analytics technologies that leverage social, location, and other data to attract and retain customers, both online and in brick and mortar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How agile is our business? Can we deliver high-value impact at low cost and risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often describe two dimensions of business agility: strategic and operational. Strategic agility could be, for example, the speed with with a third-party technology can be integrated into an existing system. Business agility would be a measure such as time to market. These two dimensions produce a measure I call &lt;strong&gt;Agile Leverage&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the degree to which an organization can quickly deliver high-value solutions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-873&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/agility-300x292.png&#34; alt=&#34;agility&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;292&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/agility-52x50.png 52w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/agility-300x292.png 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/agility.png 333w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can maximize our Agile Leverage via the technology function in several ways. We can reduce the number of systems (I call this &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;minimizing the boxes and arrows&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;), improving data quality through standards, adopting agile product/project management methodologies, or enabling resource scaling via the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I help my clients drive both strategic and operational business agility in order to respond quickly and competitively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

They needed to deliver more value to their customers more often, and at lower cost. However, they just couldn&amp;#8217;t seem to improve. When I paid them a visit, I looked at their product development lifecycle as a whole. Their product roadmap was solid, their requirements specifications and test plans were clear, the team had all the right skills, and their quality was high. So what could be improved?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This company thought they were doing all the right things. Then I interviewed the software team, and the truth came out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rework was killing them&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unbeknownst to senior management, product managers were frequently changing requirements after the original specifications were implemented and tested. I discovered that it was common for a couple of their product managers to ask their buddies on the development team to just go ahead and add this &lt;em&gt;one little thing&lt;/em&gt; as a favor. No big deal, right? They would add them, then these little changes would break 5 other things. Then 5 new bugs were opened, 5 fixes, 5 retests, and everything works again. At the end of the day, everything was working fine and someone got their pet feature added. Senior management was none the wiser.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the problem: all that rework has a cost. You may think that because everyone is on salary that these off-book changes were &amp;#8220;free.&amp;#8221; &lt;strong&gt;You&amp;#8217;d be wrong.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Consider opportunity cost&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All that time spent on sneaking in changes and fixing the fixes adds up. Time that could have been better spent on higher value features. I calculated that my client was losing around &lt;strong&gt;$340,000/year&lt;/strong&gt; to this unplanned rework! This obviously had to stop. What more could &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; do with that kind of savings?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what we changed&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We introduced agile practices to the software development processes. This approach enables the incremental delivery of products, instead of one &amp;#8220;big bang&amp;#8221; at the end. Incremental delivery allows us to inspect and adapt to changing requirements &amp;#8211; with complete transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to deliver a product incrementally, we break down requirements into user stories, prioritize them in a backlog, and continuously implement, test, and release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working in this manner &lt;strong&gt;minimizes rework&lt;/strong&gt;, isolating it to either small bug fixes, or refining the user stories in the current iteration. We can now inspect and adapt, consistently creating value instead of creating waste.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Result&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My client&amp;#8217;s organization is still adjusting to working iteratively &amp;#8211; the agile way. This is normal. But the payoff is immediate &amp;#8211; rework is negligible, and customers get to enjoy new features sooner. That translates to not only cost savings, but a much shorter path to new revenue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;My Challenge for You&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider the following questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much productivity in your organization is lost to rework? How would you know?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you deliver a product incrementally? How frequently?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What can you do right now to go faster, with higher quality, and at lower cost?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Need help answering these questions? &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/contact/&#34;&gt;Give me a call&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Fail Fast and Succeed</title>

      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/how-to-fail-fast-and-succeed/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fail.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-852 alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fail-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;fail&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fail-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fail-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fail.jpg 1600w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;With the end of the year fast approaching, my clients are now focusing like a laser what they would like to accomplish in 2016. Many are finalizing their technology strategy, investing in DevOps practices and tools, committing to Agile transformation, and leveraging the Cloud. All these efforts enable my clients to do two things they couldn&amp;#8217;t before: &lt;strong&gt;fail fast and pivot&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we mean by fail fast?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When developing new solutions with my clients, we embrace a feedback loop. That is, quickly get something in front of customers, solicit feedback, inspect and adapt, and then decide how to proceed. Most often, we make changes to the product based on customer feedback, but sometimes we terminate a bad idea before more money is spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the concept of failure takes on new meaning. With previous non-agile processes, you would create a product over a long period of time and bring it to market fully baked. Then, the market would determine if what you created has value, meets needs, or just plain stinks. Time and money have been needlessly squandered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a better way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work with clients to &lt;strong&gt;redefine failure&lt;/strong&gt; as simply an iterative test of assumptions. We embrace the inevitable imperfections in our product, and &lt;strong&gt;pivot&lt;/strong&gt; to meet the market need. We do this early and often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Edison once said of his mistakes, &amp;#8220;I have not failed 10,000 times. I have not failed once. I have succeeded in proving that those 10,000 ways will not work. When I have eliminated the ways that will not work, I will find the way that will work.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being agile means your product is never done. I&amp;#8217;ve seen countless companies play roulette with ambitious products and initiatives. These efforts either fail to see the light of day, or once launched, crash and burn in the marketplace. Money, morale, and shareholder value go down the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working this way also allows us to more easily establish cause and effect. Perhaps a product performs poorly in the market because of a usability or design flaw. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s pricing. Or performance. If we make too many changes over too long a period of time, the distance between cause and effect prevents us from responding quickly to feedback. ​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save Money While Making Money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late 90s and for a while after, I worked for a number of dot-com bubble startups. Absurd valuations, nebulous business models, and venture capital speculation were the name of the game. Companies used other people&amp;#8217;s money to produce products of questionable value, usually without profit. It was clearly unsustainable, which is why nearly all of those companies are gone now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, business owners, executives, investors, and shareholders want to see dividends early and often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producing a product iteratively allows us to get revenue much earlier than ever before. We can use this revenue, even if minimal, to fund the development of additional features. We add value, then customers respond with more of their money. Another feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge Questions for Business Leaders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your process allow you to quickly and easily implement and test new features in the market?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you quickly isolate which feature changes contribute to success and failure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How fast can you incorporate customer feedback into your next release?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How to Prevent Project Failure</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/how-to-prevent-project-failure/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2015 02:39:47 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/how-to-prevent-project-failure/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;alignleft wp-image-840 size-medium&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/static1.squarespace-300x212.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Choosing between failure and success&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;212&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/static1.squarespace-300x212.jpg 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/static1.squarespace.jpg 900w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;Many years ago, I subcontracted on a large software project. It was an automotive warranty claims processing system. Many consultants had cycled through this organization over 3 or 4 years, none ever seeming to make a dent towards completing the project. I personally spent eighteen months on this project. Rumor has it that almost $30 million was ultimately spent, with little to show for it. Yes, you read that correctly.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  How do unproductive projects fester like this for so long, and with such expense? I noticed a few behaviors that contributed to failure, and over the years, I’ve seen them time and time again. Do these sound familiar to you?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Unclear Objectives&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  I’ve seen dozens of projects fail simply because nobody knew why they were working on them. It may seem obvious that anyone involved in a project would know why they are working on it, but this often isn’t the case over time. Competing objectives at the executive level tend to morph a project from trying to satisfy one objective to many. I’ve also seen ambitious executives use one project to try to “sneak” another one in under the radar. This has the net effect of fuzzy goals, scope creep, and lousy technical design. Timelines inevitably slide, nothing ships, and morale suffers.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Constantly Changing Requirements&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  After over two decades in software engineering, I am still amazed when I see project requirements changing often, yet every other variable is held constant. That is, you are given a deadline, a set headcount and budget, and are told to “make due” when requirements change every other day. This is a recipe for failure and burnout, and it’s unsustainable. Something has to give, and it’s usually quality first.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Vaporware&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  Your sales team is presenting at an industry trade show. A senior executive of a Fortune 500 organization they have been trying to land stops by for a demo. She is dazzled by what she sees, and the sales team promises not only the moon and stars, but also delivery in eight weeks. There’s just one problem &amp;#8211; the product doesn’t exist yet. Now your engineering team is tasked with innovating on a deadline. This is known as “vaporware.” To make matters worse, the CIO hasn’t been consulted on matters of budget, priority, headcount, or complexity. But the CEO sees dollar signs, and orders the troops to “make it happen.” What could possibly go wrong?
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Overengineering&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  We’ve discussed scope creep. This one is a little more insidious &amp;#8211; scope &lt;i&gt;seep&lt;/i&gt;. That is, features, functionality, and other complexity introduced not by the client, but by the engineers themselves. Many engineers are tempted to “gold plate” their solutions with fancy methodologies, standards, or technologies, with the intent of maximizing quality. While this is well-intended, it tends to inflate projects in both time and cost. Now, I’m not suggesting we abandon proven approaches, but we must remain practical and flexible…we must be &lt;b&gt;agile&lt;/b&gt;.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;strong&gt;Agile to the Rescue&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  I work with clients to deliver software in as little as 30 days. I don’t mean a canned demo. I mean &lt;b&gt;working software&lt;/b&gt;. We achieve this through agile practices which address the symptoms I mentioned above. We start with clear objectives &amp;#8211; the business outcomes you seek to achieve. Then we establish the metrics by which that success will be measured. Therein, we will discover value. Using the objectives, metrics, and value as “guard rails” for a project, we are free to embrace changing requirements, avoid the trap of vaporware, and deliver just the right amount of engineering to ship software early and often.
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  Challenge Questions for Business Leaders:
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&#34;ol1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    How many of your projects have failed over the years due to one or more of the above reasons?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    Are you able to easily accommodate changes, manage risks, and lower expenses for any given project?
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    How quickly can you respond to market demand for new features?
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Are you Elastic Enough for Cyber Monday?</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/are-you-elastic-enough-for-cyber-monday/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2015 17:56:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/are-you-elastic-enough-for-cyber-monday/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine a typical week of traffic to your company&amp;#8217;s web store. This pattern might look a lot like your own traffic, with a peak during the middle of the day, and a slowdown in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone wp-image-814 size-full&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Provsioned-Capacity.png&#34; alt=&#34;Provsioned Capacity&#34; width=&#34;721&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Provsioned-Capacity-300x94.png 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Provsioned-Capacity.png 721w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this pattern, it becomes really easy to do capacity planning. We can provision, say 15% over what we see our normal peak to be, and be happy with the capacity we have for a while, so long as our traffic matches this pattern. But, we&amp;#8217;re in the first week of November. Check out this traffic graph from one of my e-commerce clients from last November:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone wp-image-817 size-full&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/November-Traffic.png&#34; alt=&#34;November Traffic&#34; width=&#34;722&#34; height=&#34;319&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/November-Traffic-300x133.png 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/November-Traffic.png 722w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graphic represents the entire month of November. We can see big growth at the end of the month with Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. If we stuck with our &amp;#8220;add 15%&amp;#8221; rule of thumb applied to the spikes, we&amp;#8217;d be in deep trouble for the month. That&amp;#8217;s a lot of wasted capacity and cost &amp;#8211; potentially 76% wasted, with only 24% of it on average utilized for the month. Traditionally, this is how IT has done things. You bought servers for a 6-12 month vision for what growth might look like. So, what&amp;#8217;s the solution to all this waste?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migrating your infrastructure to the cloud enables elasticity and autoscaling, allowing us to map your capacity directly to end-user needs. We can ensure that at any given point in time, only what you need is provisioned, versus an arbitrary guess at capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my clients&amp;#8217; web stores was hosted on an outdated infrastructure at the end of its lifecycle. Bandwidth was not optimized and the company recognized that the maintenance costs were no longer sustainable. Furthermore, the old website infrastructure was not scalable, preventing the company from supporting new online initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were able to take advantage of the cloud to quickly design and implement a new architecture that could meet workload demands. As a result, we launched their new web store in less than a month. Infrastructure costs were reduced by 50% with improved performance and scalability. Time to market is now close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you elastic enough for Cyber Monday?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge Questions for Business Leaders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are you prepared to handle unforeseen spikes in demand?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much money are you wasting in unused capacity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How quickly can you launch a new offering with your current infrastructure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>We’ve Always Done it That Way (WADITW)</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/weve-always-done-it-that-way-waditw/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 29 Oct 2015 19:42:53 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/weve-always-done-it-that-way-waditw/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;People hate change. We have our habits, routines, and preferences that drive us to act, or in many cases &lt;strong&gt;fail to act&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-809 alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/habits-300x155.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;habits&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;155&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/habits-300x155.jpg 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/habits-1024x528.jpg 1024w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/habits.jpg 1445w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I engage with a new client, I spend a lot of time not only understanding their business processes, but also the &lt;strong&gt;rationale&lt;/strong&gt; for those processes. It&amp;#8217;s my job to question and challenge these processes, with the goal of improving (or even removing) them to create new value for my clients.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am constantly surprised by really smart, educated clients who tell me &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;ve always done it that way,&amp;#8221; unable to explain the reasons why things are so. They have a belief that deviating from this norm will somehow cause loss or pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Throw out the process manual&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve worked with Fortune 500 organizations that needed to innovate quickly. However, the regulatory and compliance climate of the past 15 years created processes and procedures that continued to drive organizational behavior. Traditional product development approaches took too long, and by the time the solution was delivered, it was either uncompetitive or obsolete.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My most successful clients took a leap of faith and adopted agile or lean methods to quickly deliver new offerings to customers. Initially, they resisted this major change, comfortable in their &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;ve always done it that way&amp;#8221; approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can understand their hesitation. I had one client who &lt;strong&gt;actually preferred&lt;/strong&gt; a 100 page specification document, Gantt chart, work breakdown structure, fixed cost estimates, and a firm deadline. This approach offered the &lt;strong&gt;perception of a guaranteed budget, scope, and date&lt;/strong&gt;.  The budget, scope, and date of any project inevitably change. In over twenty years, I&amp;#8217;ve never had a project stick to all three.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&amp;#8217;m not here to sell you a methodology&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consultants love their methodologies. I don&amp;#8217;t have one to sell you because I don&amp;#8217;t believe in one-size-fits-all when it comes to my clients&amp;#8217; success. What I will offer you are these &lt;strong&gt;advantages&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Change&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; We accept the fact that scope will change over the life of a project. User feedback, external factors (competitors, regulations, etc.), and unforeseen complexity are givens. We avoid failure by delivering the system that is needed, as opposed to one designed in a vacuum.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Iteration&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; The ideal way to address change is to work in discrete steps towards an end state that we accept to be in flux. Details change. We gain new insights along the way. We inspect and adapt. Working this way avoids costly and time consuming requirements documents. My clients&amp;#8217; staff is energized by being able to work on something new &lt;strong&gt;early and often&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Feedback&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; In order to identify and act upon change, we need frequent feedback. I coach most of my clients in Scrum (or some agile variant thereof), whose various &amp;#8220;ceremonies&amp;#8221; include a daily standup, sprint review, and retrospective. My clients welcome this approach, as changing insights, requirements, and risks are discovered regularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Value&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;#8211; I help my clients achieve business value at the end of every iteration or sprint. We will have a potentially &lt;strong&gt;shippable product&lt;/strong&gt; every few weeks. This success engages customers and delights end users, where they can see the project has taken on life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Software development is an unpredictable process. I help my clients &lt;strong&gt;take the risk out of the chaos&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Questions for Business Leaders:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How easily can you adapt to rapid change with your current process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are your customers involved in your product development process, or do they only see the end result?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your organization collaborate, or do they follow draconian processes?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft wp-image-801&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/6a00d8341c630a53ef01630626d091970d-640wi.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;SANTA ANA, CA - NOVEMBER, 23, 2011: A U.S. Airways airplane flies over the 405 freeway as it approaches it&#39;s landing at John Wayne Airport in Orange County as travelers make their way to their destinations in time to celebrate Thanksgiving. ( Allen J. Schaben  / Los Angeles Times)&#34; width=&#34;477&#34; height=&#34;301&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/6a00d8341c630a53ef01630626d091970d-640wi-300x189.jpg 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/6a00d8341c630a53ef01630626d091970d-640wi-320x202.jpg 320w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/6a00d8341c630a53ef01630626d091970d-640wi.jpg 640w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Wayne airport in Santa Ana, California has a rather unique set of takeoff requirements. Its runway, at 5,701 feet, is one of the shortest among commercial airports in the US. A Boeing 757 is the largest airplane that can be accommodated. It also has very strict noise requirements. My cousin lives next door in quiet Irvine, and told me that airplanes must take off at full throttle, shooting off the runway like a rocket, then quickly back down the engines to keep quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me think of some of the companies with whom I&amp;#8217;ve worked. Many were startups, either bootstrapping themselves or anemically funded with venture capital. Others were reasonably mature, but lacked sufficient capitalization to execute on their strategy effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major issue with these types of companies is that they have lofty goals, but want everything under the sun in a short time frame. And their budgets are limited. The classical project management response to this situation is, &amp;#8220;you can have good, fast, and cheap. Pick two.&amp;#8221; &lt;strong&gt;I hate this answer&lt;/strong&gt;, and it reeks of in-the-box thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agile software development works perfectly with short runways. You can get a high quality result in a short time frame. &lt;strong&gt;You can get the airplane off the ground before you run out of runway.&lt;/strong&gt; You just have to change your thinking a bit. Focus on what you &lt;strong&gt;need, &lt;/strong&gt;not what you &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve found these are often not the same things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will likely need some coaching to get comfortable with this approach. I help my clients evaluate their strategic goals and tactical objectives, formulating a launch plan that can get the proverbial plane off the ground with runway to spare.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Programming Language Choice Doesn’t Matter</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/programming-language-choice-doesnt-matter/</link>

      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/programming-language-choice-doesnt-matter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone wp-image-792&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/prog-languages.png&#34; alt=&#34;prog-languages&#34; width=&#34;437&#34; height=&#34;182&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/prog-languages-300x125.png 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/prog-languages.png 620w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sucks. Java is dead. Rails can&amp;#8217;t scale. Python is slow. I&amp;#8217;ve heard it all, and I can tell you &lt;strong&gt;none of it matters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers are an interesting breed; they tend to stick to what they know best, but also love to tinker with new technologies. These experiments often fail at the expense of a project&amp;#8217;s success, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my clients struggle with technology choice for new projects. Business owners and executives are hesitant to try newer technologies, but by the same token don&amp;#8217;t want to be left driving an Edsel. &lt;em&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re younger than 40, you probably didn&amp;#8217;t get that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do I say these choices don&amp;#8217;t matter? When it comes to programming languages/platforms, what matters most to my clients is &lt;strong&gt;speed&lt;/strong&gt;. Time to market is everything. That said, here are some &amp;#8220;guard rails&amp;#8221; to help guide your thinking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use What You Know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a business owner or executive with technology experience, you probably have a bias when it comes to specific technologies. If you&amp;#8217;re a .NET gal, for example, you&amp;#8217;ll probably pick that because you&amp;#8217;ll more easily understand what&amp;#8217;s delivered. If you have a development team, ask them what they want to use. You may find that your team of PHP geeks absolutely hates using that, and would love to switch to Ruby, Node.js, or some better tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use What You Can Hire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have a preference for a particular technology, but the local job market is devoid of candidates. I live in South Florida, and it&amp;#8217;s been almost entirely Microsoftland for 15 years. That&amp;#8217;s changing, but my local clients tend to stick with Microsoft technologies just because of the availability of local talent. Some of my other clients are comfortable with remote workers, so the talent pool for other technologies is far larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use What You Can Learn Quickly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve worked with many companies that were steadfast Microsoft shops for years. Newer technologies, changes in leadership, or other factors sometimes inspire a look at something new. Given the choice between _Shiny New Object &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;, _if all things are equal, choose the one you can learn quickly. Remember &amp;#8211; time to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When choosing a new technology, don&amp;#8217;t get stuck in analysis paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Get your Head out of the Cloud!</title>

      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/get-your-head-out-of-the-cloud/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-786&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Head-In-The-Clouds.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Head-In-The-Clouds&#34; width=&#34;540&#34; height=&#34;382&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Head-In-The-Clouds-300x212.jpg 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Head-In-The-Clouds.jpg 540w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Software is a means to an end, not an end in and of itself.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;My long-time client, a general contractor, called me this weekend with a “great idea” for some custom cloud-based software that will transform his business. I get calls like this all the time; these requests usually go something like this:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&#34;ol1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Client is in pain&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Build a new software system&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;No more pain&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Profit!&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;cloudy thinking&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;I asked my client about his real objectives, and he started rattling off requirements for this piece of magic software. The problem with this thinking is that it may give you what you &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt;, but it doesn’t necessarily give you what you &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt;. Most consultants, especially in the software business, will approach these projects as opportunities to rack up endless billable hours to create a brilliant application that &lt;strong&gt;doesn’t do a damn thing&lt;/strong&gt; to help the customer’s real pain.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;We discussed the underlying pain he was suffering. It had nothing to do with inefficient software. &lt;strong&gt;He had too much business!&lt;/strong&gt; He was turning away jobs because he simply didn’t have the personal bandwidth or manpower to scale his operation up.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;He also revealed a secondary goal – to expand nationally. As a local contractor, he can’t possibly take jobs nationwide. How could he be everywhere? He has a strong brand – one we could leverage as a marketing tool.&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-converted-space&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So we created a plan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Social CRM to the rescue.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;I implemented a cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to manage his growing national referral network, and to ensure consistency in his branding. Through social media and other channels, we advertised him nationally, and referred jobs out to local contractors under his brand, sharing the revenue. The local contractors were free to use whatever software systems they liked, so long as the end customer received reports and other materials using my clients’ branding.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;While I did create some custom software, it was not at all what my client originally envisioned. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;However, it is what he &lt;strong&gt;needed&lt;/strong&gt;. Software is simply the enabler of a solid business plan. We approached the business plan first, and the implementation details later.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;We started with a request for new software, but followed this line of thinking instead:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&#34;ol1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Understand the pain&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Define a business objective&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Determine measures of success&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Evaluate the value of the effort&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Implement&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Alleviate pain&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Profit!&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Much better, right?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;I am passionate about building cloud-based systems and leveraging technology to solve business problems. However, it’s ultimately the business problems I help solve which creates the real value, not the tools used to get there.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Is your head in the cloud?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Challenge Questions for Business Leaders&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&#34;ol1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;What pain are you suffering, for which you’ve been considering a technology solution?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;What are your longer term strategic goals?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;What have you tried before that didn’t work?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>What’s your SCAM Strategy for 2016?</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/whats-your-scam-strategy-for-2016/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2015 14:20:33 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/whats-your-scam-strategy-for-2016/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wp-image-776 alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SCAM.png&#34; alt=&#34;SCAM&#34; width=&#34;328&#34; height=&#34;314&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SCAM-52x50.png 52w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SCAM-300x287.png 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SCAM.png 790w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’re in Q4, your technology strategy for 2016 should be well formed. So what’s your plan for SCAM? The Social, Cloud, Analytics, and Mobile (SCAM) stack presents a framework in which organizations can align marketing and technical efforts with a customer-centric strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-media-is-the-new-crm&#34;&gt;Social Media is the New CRM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have an innate need for affiliation. We join clubs, professional associations, play sports, and even practice our religions, to one degree or another, in order to satisfy this need. Social media is the modern extension of this community-building. We friend, tweet, pin, share, and like; we are not only expressing our individuality online, but also identifying with groups and brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s all well and good for sharing cat videos and pictures of your kids, right? &lt;strong&gt;WRONG&lt;/strong&gt;. Social media is a powerful tool to engage your existing customers, and attract new ones, all by capitalizing on their need for affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.noahfleming.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Noah Fleming&lt;/a&gt; writes about community in his book &lt;em&gt;Evergreen&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;#8220;as our customers are becoming more interconnected, they are naturally beginning to build elements of community on their own. Furthermore, if you don&amp;#8217;t create a strong customer community, you can be guaranteed that your competitors will.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems are transactional in nature. They collect data on customers, transactions, and contact histories. &lt;strong&gt;Social CRM&lt;/strong&gt; allows companies to directly interact with customers &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt;, observe how they communicate with each other, and gauge sentiment about your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media isn&amp;#8217;t just for marketers either. Inbound customer service also leverages social media, offering customers a deeper sense of connectedness than an 800 number or a contact form on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my clients is the CEO/Owner of an online vitamin supplement company. We were discussing how his larger competitors engaged with customers using social media. While these companies had a team of customer service folks monitoring social media, and interacting with customers, they were too big for their CEO to respond personally. I suggested this was an opportunity for him to &lt;strong&gt;differentiate&lt;/strong&gt; by being directly accessible by his customers via social media. He quickly discovered that he could more quickly obtain customer information than waiting passively for new sales to come in. Learning his customers’ demographics through social media analytics (more on that later) allowed him to save money on advertising campaigns that targeted the wrong segments. Talking with me on Twitter as &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mrichman&#34;&gt;@mrichman&lt;/a&gt; instead of promoting at me with an ad goes a long way to building trust and loyalty through transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud&#34;&gt;Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All organizations are under increasing pressure to maximize their return on technology investment. As budgets shift funds from IT to marketing, the IT organization seeks to save costs. Leveraging a cloud provider, as opposed to maintaining on-premise infrastructure, takes advantage of economies of scale to consume more computing power at lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to the cloud allows for investment using operational expenditures (OPEX), rather than capital expenditures (CAPEX). CFOs no longer concern themselves with depreciating assets, and large lump-sum investments in infrastructure. This approach &lt;strong&gt;frees cash&lt;/strong&gt; for investment in other areas of the business, and reduces the footprint of the IT department as a cost center in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my clients are e-commerce companies, and often have to prepare their infrastructure for peaks in traffic. They usually do this by purchasing far more equipment than is needed for typical demand, and often hosting in redundant data centers to mitigate the risk of downtime. Cloud environments allow for &lt;strong&gt;flexible computing power &lt;/strong&gt;that scales on-demand, paying for only what is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security concerns, maintenance, and upgrades account for significant investment in both service agreements and labor. Many cloud infrastructures eliminate or greatly reduce the constant demand for mundane maintenance tasks. Cloud providers with more specialized staff and a greater focus on security can offer CIOs peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite reason to move to the cloud is &lt;strong&gt;speed&lt;/strong&gt;. What used to take weeks or even months to spec out, order, provision, and configure, and can now be done in hours or less. This allows organizations to rapidly respond to changes in market demand, and the organization can better avoid the losing proposition of an on-premise physical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;analytics&#34;&gt;Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, “big data” is all the rage. But all the data in the world is useless if it’s not relevant and actionable. That’s where analytics come in. Your data can come from a wide variety of sources, from social media, e-commerce transactions, website traffic, financial reports, and so on. We’re able to do more than just track clicks now. We can infer relationships between customers and our products and services, and make predictions about their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working with a number of clients to develop 1:1 marketing programs (also called “one-off” marketing) using historical transaction data. Using analytics tools (often more than one), I look at repeat vs. non-repeat customers, time of day or week, and geographic location in order to segment the customer base. Using this data, we can tailor email campaigns, intercept promotions, and product recommendations to a specific customer’s shopping preferences. Ultimately, this not only increases conversion rates, but also average order value and purchase frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mobile&#34;&gt;Mobile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your web strategy is not mobile-first, you&amp;#8217;re doing it wrong. Over half of all web searches are now from mobile devices. Optimizing your website for mobility or having a native application can take advantage of your customers&amp;#8217; location and identity, for example, allowing for a more customized experience. Providing mobile-optimized productivity applications to your workforce will also enable them to be more productive. Many users now have three or more mobile devices &amp;#8211; smartphones, tablets, laptops, and even watches. It&amp;#8217;s more important than ever to target these devices as first-class citizens as part of your technology strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;challenge-questions-for-leaders&#34;&gt;Challenge Questions for Leaders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does your social media and social CRM strategy engage more prospects and customers, and build a community?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is your enterprise architecture equipped to support SCAM challenges?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can your software development process keep up with the rapidly evolving SCAM landscape?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your team have the tools, skills, and processes in place to execute your SCAM strategy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

  The role of CIO as Chief &lt;em&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/em&gt; Officer is becoming increasingly irrelevant. IT budgets have shifted to Marketing. Corporate infrastructure is moving to the cloud. So what&amp;#8217;s left? &lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;enter-the-chief-data-officer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter the Chief Data Officer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Data belongs to the business, not just to IT. The CDO represents these business interests. If the CIO&amp;#8217;s job is simply to keep the lights on, that&amp;#8217;s not something the rest of the business will relate to. If CIOs are to survive, they must evolve, much like the technology for which they have been responsible.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Business intelligence, data analytics, and the value delivered to the business from SCAM (social, cloud, analytics, mobile) will become the primary driver of strategy. We already see this transformation occurring, and CMOs continue to wrestle away not only dollars, but also organizational ownership of the customer. The CMO becomes the CDO&amp;#8217;s best customer.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-cdo-is-a-hybrid-executive&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CDO is a Hybrid Executive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  The most effective CDO will be a &lt;i&gt;hybrid&lt;/i&gt; executive. Often graduating from a CIO or CTO role, their responsibilities will overlap several disciplines:
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decision Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital Transformation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  The CDO is a transformational leader, driving business value by integrating emerging technologies with external marketing and customer facing initiatives with internal processes and applications.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-the-cio-can-thrive&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the CIO can Thrive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  The successful CIO will be the one who can take their organization and gear it toward the ability to program infrastructure as code, and serve new application development, driven by social, cloud, analytics, and mobile.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What opportunities do you have for creating and enhancing the business value of data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your strategy for responding to SCAM (social, cloud, analytics, mobile) requirements of the business?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will you reshape the business to take advantage of data and technology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
