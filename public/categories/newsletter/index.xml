      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-919 alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/orgift-featured-300x138.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;138&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/orgift-featured-300x138.jpg 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/orgift-featured.jpg 630w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;For the last few years, especially in the software development space, we&amp;#8217;ve been hearing the word &amp;#8220;agile&amp;#8221; thrown around ad nauseam. Concepts such as iterative design, adaptive planning, collaboration, self-organization, continuous delivery, and so on flood the current literature.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve spent the last several years working with clients to develop and improve their agile practices, improving quality and time-to-market. The result has been great for software teams and customers alike. But aren&amp;#8217;t we leaving the rest of the organization out in the cold? How can we apply these practices beyond software development, improving the business from the top down?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the &lt;em&gt;Agile Organization&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Small companies, like the startups with whom I&amp;#8217;ve been involved, embrace agility as their default. Larger, more established companies, tend to move less nimbly as they grow, exposing themselves to disruption by more agile players. Let&amp;#8217;s look at a few strategies to help us achieve agility.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Speeding Adoption&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my clients have been struggling to implement agile practices throughout their organization, often taking a couple of years to apply it to every program and project. This kind of _variable adoption_ often indicates a lack of commitment to change. With parts of the organization operating at different cadences, tremendous friction develops, stalling progress. I&amp;#8217;ve worked with diehards, skeptics, and even saboteurs to make agile a reality. Speeding up the agile adoption process in the face of naysayers requires a leap of faith, but one that is supported by years of supporting evidence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone is a Leader&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the secret weapons of Agile&amp;#8217;s success is the role of the individual contributor. Innovators, specialists, and organizers all have equal influence. There is no place for a hands-off manager sitting behind a desk in an agile organization. In some of the best performing organizations with whom I&amp;#8217;ve worked, the teams often assign deliverables to executives, and not the other way around. Steve Jobs once said, &amp;#8220;&lt;span style=&#34;line-height: 1.5;&#34;&gt;it doesn’t make sense to hire smart people and tell them what to do; we hire smart people so they can tell us what to do.&amp;#8221; The agile organization is a collective; trust in each of your people to take a leadership role.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Decide Fast, Fail Faster&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agile organizations make decisions quickly. This is not to be confused with unmitigated risk-taking. I&amp;#8217;ve seen companies grind to a halt under the strain of &lt;em&gt;analysis paralysis&lt;/em&gt;, forestalling critical decisions due to perceived risk. Longer development cycles increase this risk substantially. I work with my clients to shorten these cycle times. With smaller, more frequent deliveries to market, we can inspect, analyze, and adapt to change. If we fail, by whatever metric we choose, we can take advantage of the learning to improve our decision making and recover quickly. This is the iterative nature of agile, and therein lies its effectiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Challenge Questions for Business Leaders:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have a stalled agile adoption in your organization, or varying rates of adoption?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Have you empowered everyone at all levels to be a decision maker?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are you missing market opportunities due to stalled decisions or slow production cycles?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 Lessons My Clients Taught Me in 2015</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-911 alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/project-lessons-learned-300x208.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;project-lessons-learned&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;208&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/project-lessons-learned-300x208.jpg 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/project-lessons-learned.jpg 620w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;Another year in the books. I&amp;#8217;ve had the privilege to help organizations grow, transform, and improve. Along the way, my clients have taught me some valuable lessons that shape how I work. You can&amp;#8217;t stop learning when you view everyone you meet as a teacher.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;change-is-hard&#34;&gt;Change is Hard&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have worked with a wide variety of client personality types over the years; some are excited, motivated and proactive about change. Others can be insecure, anxious, or apprehensive. All have had at least a short period of discomfort as they changed their mindsets and routines to a new way of doing things. Learning new skills, behaviors, tools, and processes can take from a few weeks to a year, depending on the client. Keeping these realities in mind, it is my job to support my clients through change.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;never-stop-learning&#34;&gt;Never Stop Learning&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My clients endeavor to understand more about the technology landscape. It always amazes me when a client repeats back something I taught them, even after I&amp;#8217;ve long forgotten what I said. Ultimately, much of my learning is done while I work with my clients and their teams. I learn from every experience and interaction, and apply that knowledge to future projects. I embrace these challenges, focusing on my passions, and I have fun!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;share-success&#34;&gt;Share Success&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I genuinely care about my clients, and I&amp;#8217;m excited about my consulting, coaching, training, and speaking opportunities. I&amp;#8217;m just as elated as my clients when we successfully achieve our goals. Even when the going might get tough, clients are motivated by a consistently reliable, knowledgeable consultant who loves what they do and is as committed to success as they are to their long term relationship with the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;be-flexible&#34;&gt;Be Flexible&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Project focus and direction can change on a dime and so can your clients&amp;#8217; strategy and objectives. You need to be ready to shift gears and adjust quickly to changes within the organizations that you work with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;friendships-are-not-bounded-by-age&#34;&gt;Friendships are not Bounded by Age&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My peer group had always been +/- 3 years. Now I&amp;#8217;ve got friends 40 years older and 15 years younger, directly as a result of those with whom I work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-brown-hair-isn-8217-t-coming-back&#34;&gt;The Brown hair isn&amp;#8217;t Coming Back&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The arrow of time only points in one direction. Okay, I guess that&amp;#8217;s six things. Must be the old age.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Five Must-Answer Tech Strategy Questions</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/five-must-answer-tech-strategy-questions/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2015 20:31:48 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/five-must-answer-tech-strategy-questions/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;​Many of my senior-executive clients have been called upon by their boards to get directly involved in technology issues. These boards are also starting to think strategically about technology, and how industry trends are shaping their companies&amp;#8217; future. More than ever, we need to ask questions that keep us focused on the right issues. While working with clients on new projects, or meeting prospective clients for the first time, I&amp;#8217;ve collected a series of &amp;#8220;must-answer&amp;#8221; questions that bring clarity to any technology strategy initiative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How often does your board discuss technology topics?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my clients lament that technology-specific topics are raised, on average, only twice a year at the board level. This level of strategic attention to technology isn&amp;#8217;t just insufficient, it&amp;#8217;s negligent. Boards as well as executive teams must consider the competitive landscape, keeping their eye on not only well-known competitors, but more importantly, from emerging competitors with distruptive technologies. I encourage frequent (at least quarterly) discussions to help keep the focus on competitveness, lest my clients face decimation by a more nible innovator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What technology-related issues are addressed by your leadership?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sadly, most executive teams relegate their technology discussions to the usual Keeping the Lights On (KTLO) issues. These are tasks such as application maintenance, change requests, standard updates, and general systems maintenance. This is at least a $1 Trillion travesty and upwards of 80% of my clients&amp;#8217; IT budgets are spent on KTLO. I help my clients elevate the importance of technology in their organizations from that of a commoditized utility to a strategic value-center. Thinking about that big data or cloud deployment, but you&amp;#8217;ve got KTLO issues? Don&amp;#8217;t do it without talking to me first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Do you have a technologist on your board? How does their presence affect the focus on technology issues?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;#8217;t, you&amp;#8217;re endangering your business. Meaningful technology discussions at the board level are impossible without a technology-literate membership. I&amp;#8217;m not suggesting your CIO or CTO become board members, but I do advocate technology literacy at the board level. I&amp;#8217;ve worked with clients to develop &amp;#8220;tech strategy boot camps&amp;#8221; to achieve literacy in common issues such as data security, agile product management, big data, cloud, and other topics that board members of technology organizations should be conversant in. While this doesn&amp;#8217;t automatically turn novices into experts, it does offer an opportunity to become familiar with core issues affecting business strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What experience do our customers expect, and how can we better delight them?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work with a number of e-commerce clients. They all face constant pressure from the likes of Apple, Amazon, and others to provide an insanely convenient and personal experience. Competing with these retail juggernauts, expecting to beat them at their own game is quixotic. Instead, we create disruptive programs to delight customers through innovative approaches to convenience and service. More traditional companies, such as banks, are deepening their investments in big data and analytics technologies that leverage social, location, and other data to attract and retain customers, both online and in brick and mortar.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How agile is our business? Can we deliver high-value impact at low cost and risk?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often describe two dimensions of business agility: strategic and operational. Strategic agility could be, for example, the speed with with a third-party technology can be integrated into an existing system. Business agility would be a measure such as time to market. These two dimensions produce a measure I call &lt;strong&gt;Agile Leverage&lt;/strong&gt;. This is the degree to which an organization can quickly deliver high-value solutions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-medium wp-image-873&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/agility-300x292.png&#34; alt=&#34;agility&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;292&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/agility-52x50.png 52w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/agility-300x292.png 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/agility.png 333w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can maximize our Agile Leverage via the technology function in several ways. We can reduce the number of systems (I call this &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;minimizing the boxes and arrows&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8220;), improving data quality through standards, adopting agile product/project management methodologies, or enabling resource scaling via the cloud.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I help my clients drive both strategic and operational business agility in order to respond quickly and competitively.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Taking off from a Short Runway</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/taking-off-from-a-short-runway/</link>

      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/taking-off-from-a-short-runway/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignleft wp-image-801&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/6a00d8341c630a53ef01630626d091970d-640wi.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;SANTA ANA, CA - NOVEMBER, 23, 2011: A U.S. Airways airplane flies over the 405 freeway as it approaches it&#39;s landing at John Wayne Airport in Orange County as travelers make their way to their destinations in time to celebrate Thanksgiving. ( Allen J. Schaben  / Los Angeles Times)&#34; width=&#34;477&#34; height=&#34;301&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/6a00d8341c630a53ef01630626d091970d-640wi-300x189.jpg 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/6a00d8341c630a53ef01630626d091970d-640wi-320x202.jpg 320w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/6a00d8341c630a53ef01630626d091970d-640wi.jpg 640w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 477px) 100vw, 477px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;John Wayne airport in Santa Ana, California has a rather unique set of takeoff requirements. Its runway, at 5,701 feet, is one of the shortest among commercial airports in the US. A Boeing 757 is the largest airplane that can be accommodated. It also has very strict noise requirements. My cousin lives next door in quiet Irvine, and told me that airplanes must take off at full throttle, shooting off the runway like a rocket, then quickly back down the engines to keep quiet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This made me think of some of the companies with whom I&amp;#8217;ve worked. Many were startups, either bootstrapping themselves or anemically funded with venture capital. Others were reasonably mature, but lacked sufficient capitalization to execute on their strategy effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A major issue with these types of companies is that they have lofty goals, but want everything under the sun in a short time frame. And their budgets are limited. The classical project management response to this situation is, &amp;#8220;you can have good, fast, and cheap. Pick two.&amp;#8221; &lt;strong&gt;I hate this answer&lt;/strong&gt;, and it reeks of in-the-box thinking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Agile software development works perfectly with short runways. You can get a high quality result in a short time frame. &lt;strong&gt;You can get the airplane off the ground before you run out of runway.&lt;/strong&gt; You just have to change your thinking a bit. Focus on what you &lt;strong&gt;need, &lt;/strong&gt;not what you &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt;. I&amp;#8217;ve found these are often not the same things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You will likely need some coaching to get comfortable with this approach. I help my clients evaluate their strategic goals and tactical objectives, formulating a launch plan that can get the proverbial plane off the ground with runway to spare.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Programming Language Choice Doesn’t Matter</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/programming-language-choice-doesnt-matter/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 26 Oct 2015 00:36:19 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/programming-language-choice-doesnt-matter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone wp-image-792&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/prog-languages.png&#34; alt=&#34;prog-languages&#34; width=&#34;437&#34; height=&#34;182&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/prog-languages-300x125.png 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/prog-languages.png 620w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microsoft sucks. Java is dead. Rails can&amp;#8217;t scale. Python is slow. I&amp;#8217;ve heard it all, and I can tell you &lt;strong&gt;none of it matters.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Developers are an interesting breed; they tend to stick to what they know best, but also love to tinker with new technologies. These experiments often fail at the expense of a project&amp;#8217;s success, however.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my clients struggle with technology choice for new projects. Business owners and executives are hesitant to try newer technologies, but by the same token don&amp;#8217;t want to be left driving an Edsel. &lt;em&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re younger than 40, you probably didn&amp;#8217;t get that.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So why do I say these choices don&amp;#8217;t matter? When it comes to programming languages/platforms, what matters most to my clients is &lt;strong&gt;speed&lt;/strong&gt;. Time to market is everything. That said, here are some &amp;#8220;guard rails&amp;#8221; to help guide your thinking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use What You Know&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;re a business owner or executive with technology experience, you probably have a bias when it comes to specific technologies. If you&amp;#8217;re a .NET gal, for example, you&amp;#8217;ll probably pick that because you&amp;#8217;ll more easily understand what&amp;#8217;s delivered. If you have a development team, ask them what they want to use. You may find that your team of PHP geeks absolutely hates using that, and would love to switch to Ruby, Node.js, or some better tool for the job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use What You Can Hire&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have a preference for a particular technology, but the local job market is devoid of candidates. I live in South Florida, and it&amp;#8217;s been almost entirely Microsoftland for 15 years. That&amp;#8217;s changing, but my local clients tend to stick with Microsoft technologies just because of the availability of local talent. Some of my other clients are comfortable with remote workers, so the talent pool for other technologies is far larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use What You Can Learn Quickly&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve worked with many companies that were steadfast Microsoft shops for years. Newer technologies, changes in leadership, or other factors sometimes inspire a look at something new. Given the choice between _Shiny New Object &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;B&lt;/strong&gt;, _if all things are equal, choose the one you can learn quickly. Remember &amp;#8211; time to market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When choosing a new technology, don&amp;#8217;t get stuck in analysis paralysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Software is a means to an end, not an end in and of itself.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;My long-time client, a general contractor, called me this weekend with a “great idea” for some custom cloud-based software that will transform his business. I get calls like this all the time; these requests usually go something like this:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&#34;ol1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Client is in pain&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Build a new software system&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;No more pain&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Profit!&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;cloudy thinking&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;I asked my client about his real objectives, and he started rattling off requirements for this piece of magic software. The problem with this thinking is that it may give you what you &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt;, but it doesn’t necessarily give you what you &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt;. Most consultants, especially in the software business, will approach these projects as opportunities to rack up endless billable hours to create a brilliant application that &lt;strong&gt;doesn’t do a damn thing&lt;/strong&gt; to help the customer’s real pain.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;We discussed the underlying pain he was suffering. It had nothing to do with inefficient software. &lt;strong&gt;He had too much business!&lt;/strong&gt; He was turning away jobs because he simply didn’t have the personal bandwidth or manpower to scale his operation up.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;He also revealed a secondary goal – to expand nationally. As a local contractor, he can’t possibly take jobs nationwide. How could he be everywhere? He has a strong brand – one we could leverage as a marketing tool.&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-converted-space&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So we created a plan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Social CRM to the rescue.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;I implemented a cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to manage his growing national referral network, and to ensure consistency in his branding. Through social media and other channels, we advertised him nationally, and referred jobs out to local contractors under his brand, sharing the revenue. The local contractors were free to use whatever software systems they liked, so long as the end customer received reports and other materials using my clients’ branding.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;While I did create some custom software, it was not at all what my client originally envisioned. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;However, it is what he &lt;strong&gt;needed&lt;/strong&gt;. Software is simply the enabler of a solid business plan. We approached the business plan first, and the implementation details later.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;We started with a request for new software, but followed this line of thinking instead:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&#34;ol1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Understand the pain&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Define a business objective&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Determine measures of success&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Evaluate the value of the effort&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Implement&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Alleviate pain&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Profit!&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Much better, right?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;I am passionate about building cloud-based systems and leveraging technology to solve business problems. However, it’s ultimately the business problems I help solve which creates the real value, not the tools used to get there.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Is your head in the cloud?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Challenge Questions for Business Leaders&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&#34;ol1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;What pain are you suffering, for which you’ve been considering a technology solution?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;What are your longer term strategic goals?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;What have you tried before that didn’t work?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>What’s your SCAM Strategy for 2016?</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/whats-your-scam-strategy-for-2016/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2015 14:20:33 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/whats-your-scam-strategy-for-2016/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wp-image-776 alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SCAM.png&#34; alt=&#34;SCAM&#34; width=&#34;328&#34; height=&#34;314&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SCAM-52x50.png 52w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SCAM-300x287.png 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SCAM.png 790w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’re in Q4, your technology strategy for 2016 should be well formed. So what’s your plan for SCAM? The Social, Cloud, Analytics, and Mobile (SCAM) stack presents a framework in which organizations can align marketing and technical efforts with a customer-centric strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-media-is-the-new-crm&#34;&gt;Social Media is the New CRM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have an innate need for affiliation. We join clubs, professional associations, play sports, and even practice our religions, to one degree or another, in order to satisfy this need. Social media is the modern extension of this community-building. We friend, tweet, pin, share, and like; we are not only expressing our individuality online, but also identifying with groups and brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s all well and good for sharing cat videos and pictures of your kids, right? &lt;strong&gt;WRONG&lt;/strong&gt;. Social media is a powerful tool to engage your existing customers, and attract new ones, all by capitalizing on their need for affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.noahfleming.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Noah Fleming&lt;/a&gt; writes about community in his book &lt;em&gt;Evergreen&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;#8220;as our customers are becoming more interconnected, they are naturally beginning to build elements of community on their own. Furthermore, if you don&amp;#8217;t create a strong customer community, you can be guaranteed that your competitors will.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems are transactional in nature. They collect data on customers, transactions, and contact histories. &lt;strong&gt;Social CRM&lt;/strong&gt; allows companies to directly interact with customers &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt;, observe how they communicate with each other, and gauge sentiment about your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media isn&amp;#8217;t just for marketers either. Inbound customer service also leverages social media, offering customers a deeper sense of connectedness than an 800 number or a contact form on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my clients is the CEO/Owner of an online vitamin supplement company. We were discussing how his larger competitors engaged with customers using social media. While these companies had a team of customer service folks monitoring social media, and interacting with customers, they were too big for their CEO to respond personally. I suggested this was an opportunity for him to &lt;strong&gt;differentiate&lt;/strong&gt; by being directly accessible by his customers via social media. He quickly discovered that he could more quickly obtain customer information than waiting passively for new sales to come in. Learning his customers’ demographics through social media analytics (more on that later) allowed him to save money on advertising campaigns that targeted the wrong segments. Talking with me on Twitter as &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mrichman&#34;&gt;@mrichman&lt;/a&gt; instead of promoting at me with an ad goes a long way to building trust and loyalty through transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud&#34;&gt;Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All organizations are under increasing pressure to maximize their return on technology investment. As budgets shift funds from IT to marketing, the IT organization seeks to save costs. Leveraging a cloud provider, as opposed to maintaining on-premise infrastructure, takes advantage of economies of scale to consume more computing power at lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to the cloud allows for investment using operational expenditures (OPEX), rather than capital expenditures (CAPEX). CFOs no longer concern themselves with depreciating assets, and large lump-sum investments in infrastructure. This approach &lt;strong&gt;frees cash&lt;/strong&gt; for investment in other areas of the business, and reduces the footprint of the IT department as a cost center in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my clients are e-commerce companies, and often have to prepare their infrastructure for peaks in traffic. They usually do this by purchasing far more equipment than is needed for typical demand, and often hosting in redundant data centers to mitigate the risk of downtime. Cloud environments allow for &lt;strong&gt;flexible computing power &lt;/strong&gt;that scales on-demand, paying for only what is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security concerns, maintenance, and upgrades account for significant investment in both service agreements and labor. Many cloud infrastructures eliminate or greatly reduce the constant demand for mundane maintenance tasks. Cloud providers with more specialized staff and a greater focus on security can offer CIOs peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite reason to move to the cloud is &lt;strong&gt;speed&lt;/strong&gt;. What used to take weeks or even months to spec out, order, provision, and configure, and can now be done in hours or less. This allows organizations to rapidly respond to changes in market demand, and the organization can better avoid the losing proposition of an on-premise physical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;analytics&#34;&gt;Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, “big data” is all the rage. But all the data in the world is useless if it’s not relevant and actionable. That’s where analytics come in. Your data can come from a wide variety of sources, from social media, e-commerce transactions, website traffic, financial reports, and so on. We’re able to do more than just track clicks now. We can infer relationships between customers and our products and services, and make predictions about their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working with a number of clients to develop 1:1 marketing programs (also called “one-off” marketing) using historical transaction data. Using analytics tools (often more than one), I look at repeat vs. non-repeat customers, time of day or week, and geographic location in order to segment the customer base. Using this data, we can tailor email campaigns, intercept promotions, and product recommendations to a specific customer’s shopping preferences. Ultimately, this not only increases conversion rates, but also average order value and purchase frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mobile&#34;&gt;Mobile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your web strategy is not mobile-first, you&amp;#8217;re doing it wrong. Over half of all web searches are now from mobile devices. Optimizing your website for mobility or having a native application can take advantage of your customers&amp;#8217; location and identity, for example, allowing for a more customized experience. Providing mobile-optimized productivity applications to your workforce will also enable them to be more productive. Many users now have three or more mobile devices &amp;#8211; smartphones, tablets, laptops, and even watches. It&amp;#8217;s more important than ever to target these devices as first-class citizens as part of your technology strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;challenge-questions-for-leaders&#34;&gt;Challenge Questions for Leaders&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In what ways does your social media and social CRM strategy engage more prospects and customers, and build a community?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is your enterprise architecture equipped to support SCAM challenges?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can your software development process keep up with the rapidly evolving SCAM landscape?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your team have the tools, skills, and processes in place to execute your SCAM strategy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>The CIO should become the CDO</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/the-cio-should-become-the-cdo/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Oct 2015 16:33:54 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/the-cio-should-become-the-cdo/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;div&gt;
  The role of CIO as Chief &lt;em&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/em&gt; Officer is becoming increasingly irrelevant. IT budgets have shifted to Marketing. Corporate infrastructure is moving to the cloud. So what&amp;#8217;s left? &lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;enter-the-chief-data-officer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter the Chief Data Officer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Data belongs to the business, not just to IT. The CDO represents these business interests. If the CIO&amp;#8217;s job is simply to keep the lights on, that&amp;#8217;s not something the rest of the business will relate to. If CIOs are to survive, they must evolve, much like the technology for which they have been responsible.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Business intelligence, data analytics, and the value delivered to the business from SCAM (social, cloud, analytics, mobile) will become the primary driver of strategy. We already see this transformation occurring, and CMOs continue to wrestle away not only dollars, but also organizational ownership of the customer. The CMO becomes the CDO&amp;#8217;s best customer.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-cdo-is-a-hybrid-executive&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CDO is a Hybrid Executive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  The most effective CDO will be a &lt;i&gt;hybrid&lt;/i&gt; executive. Often graduating from a CIO or CTO role, their responsibilities will overlap several disciplines:
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decision Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital Transformation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  The CDO is a transformational leader, driving business value by integrating emerging technologies with external marketing and customer facing initiatives with internal processes and applications.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-the-cio-can-thrive&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the CIO can Thrive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  The successful CIO will be the one who can take their organization and gear it toward the ability to program infrastructure as code, and serve new application development, driven by social, cloud, analytics, and mobile.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;challenge-questions-for-leaders&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge Questions for Leaders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What opportunities do you have for creating and enhancing the business value of data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your strategy for responding to SCAM (social, cloud, analytics, mobile) requirements of the business?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will you reshape the business to take advantage of data and technology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Realtime Voice of the Customer</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/realtime-voice-of-the-customer/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Sep 2015 16:04:36 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/realtime-voice-of-the-customer/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve been working with my best clients on integrating realtime Voice of the Customer (VoC) technologies into their e-commerce operations. The results have been enlightening and profitable!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I first started with e-commerce systems around 2003, the industry was still in its infancy, and many customers still followed up online orders with multiple confirmation phone calls, or would use a vendor&amp;#8217;s website to get their phone number to place an order. This seems archaic now, just a few years later, when almost nobody picks up the phone to make a purchase. As e-commerce presences grew, the dual phone/web channels could not scale, so the direct and real time feedback of the customer was often lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we capture the Voice of the Customer, gather comments, and learn about opportunities for improvement if we don&amp;#8217;t speak to them anymore&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Email Surveys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E-commerce vendors developed email-based surveys to fill the gap left by waning telephone sales. These surveys are sent anywhere from the time of order confirmation to several days after delivery. The customer would complete the survey at their leisure, or not at all. Much of the shopping experience itself is usually out of mind by the time an email survey is completed. Over time, these have become little more than noise in a customer&amp;#8217;s inbox, and not very actionable by vendors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While not particularly useful to capture the &lt;strong&gt;shopping experience&lt;/strong&gt; itself, email surveys are still effective in a couple of cases. Major vendors, Amazon included, use email surveys to solicit feedback on the products themselves, packaging quality, or shipping speed. Most customers, however, never fill these out unless there is something negative to report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how do we capture the essence of the customer&amp;#8217;s shopping experience?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Exit Surveys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For more immediate feedback, exit surveys are usually placed on the order confirmation page, or when navigating away from this page. Customers&amp;#8217; shopping experience is still fresh in their mind, and both kudos and frustrations are more readily captured. This can also serve as an effective diagnostic tool for any technical problems with a website. I worked with one client, a $400M online retailer, to implement on-page exit surveys, and the results were astounding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their support number would occasionally ring with a customer complaint of checkout issues, only to have the order completed over the phone. This event would never get escalated to the web team for investigation. Over time, these problems just festered until a major promotion went out, when the phone rang nonstop due to shopping cart glitches. The exit survey was directed to the web team, not customer service, and issues were triaged in realtime. The root cause of the website issues was corrected, and &lt;strong&gt;conversion rate improved dramatically&lt;/strong&gt; in a week. No more hours wasted scratching your head over funnel abandon rates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Realtime Chat&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Web-based realtime chat is a terrific innovation for customers to speak to a live person, and comfortably ask questions and give feedback where a phone call is inconvenient or time consuming. Some customers are shy, or have language issues, and typing is just easier for them. Unless you&amp;#8217;re particularly short staffed, this is a fantastic tool, and there&amp;#8217;s no downside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Intercept Surveys&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I absolutely LOVE these. I use them on &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;my own website&lt;/a&gt;. Unlike email or exit surveys, you can get realtime feedback from visitors who &lt;strong&gt;chose not to buy&lt;/strong&gt;. These surveys typically take the form of a popup, and ask just a couple of key questions about the shopping experience. I also set them up to capture email addresses for lead generation. I&amp;#8217;ve also set them up to capture Net Promoter Score (NPS), demographic information, or to leak promotion codes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I often hear concerns about the intrusive nature of these popups, and whether or not they increase bounce rates. Better tools are typically more passive and configurable, appearing only at the most opportune time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While we love hearing from customers who spent money, we also need to hear from those who don&amp;#8217;t. You&amp;#8217;re not going to get these insights any other way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Can you hear your customers?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Amazon’s Outage and your Customers</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/amazons-outage-and-your-customers/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2015 16:13:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/amazons-outage-and-your-customers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past Sunday around 6am ET, &lt;a href=&#34;http://aws.amazon.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt; had a mega outage, affecting millions of customers worldwide. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon&amp;#8217;s global cloud computing infrastructure business unit. AWS powers many popular websites including Netflix, Pinterest, Expedia, IMDB, Reddit, and more. Many of my own clients rely on AWS services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple AWS systems failed simultaneously: DynamoDB, Cognito, and CloudWatch. The latter, CloudWatch, is Amazon&amp;#8217;s own cloud monitoring platform. So, the system used to monitor their own cloud went offline, unable to alert on its offline status. Everyone assumed things were humming along until applications relying on AWS services began to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies rely on cloud hosting providers like AWS for their infrastructure. When an outage strikes, it&amp;#8217;s not localized like the power company. The whole world feels it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One popular service in my area is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shipt.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shipt&lt;/a&gt;, an on-demand grocery delivery service, which uses AWS. Customers were able to place orders, but never received their groceries. Shipt started receiving lots of angry Facebook messages, tweets, and emails. Nobody was manning the phones at 6am on a Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outage was resolved after several hours, but most end customers were unaware of the root cause of their favorite sites&amp;#8217; downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think customers understand that websites can go down. They just don&amp;#8217;t want to be surprised. Sunday&amp;#8217;s event was about lack of information. When you have to Google news sites to see if a website or app is having problems, that&amp;#8217;s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SaaS companies, like the ones affected by AWS&amp;#8217;s outage, are generally powerless to resolve underlying issues with their cloud provider. So, they need to be far more proactive in customer notification when problems arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s nothing more embarrassing and trust-killing than finding out from your customers that your website is having problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve implemented many third-party and custom monitoring solutions for my clients. One client, a $400M online retailer, had frequent issues with its infrastructure provider, and I delivered a monitoring solution that would notify the marketing team of outages. They could quickly get in front of the issue by posting a notice on the website of checkout issues, and were on call to respond to social media inquiries. This one change stopped most customer service calls, and rebuilt trust with customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acquiring new customers is far more expensive than keeping existing ones. Online businesses should focus on how proactively they handle outages. The customers will trust you and stick around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What steps are you taking to respond to outages and build trust?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Postscript: As I write this, Skype is offline globally most of the day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving Business Applications to the Cloud – Part Two – Cloud Migration Strategies &amp; Challenges</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/moving-business-applications-to-the-cloud-part-one/&#34;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;, we examined the business drivers for a cloud migration. Next, let’s look at some strategies for success, and some common challenges when moving and IT organization to the cloud. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;There isn’t just one path to the cloud. When planning migrations with my clients, I present a number of proven options, with a focus on not only minimizing downtime, but also a path to growth. Most migration plans fall into one of three categories: Forklift, Refactor, or Rebuild. Let’s dive into each&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;forklift&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forklift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;The forklift strategy is generally the most popular. This is the least complex, as it simply involves copying the existing software as-is to a cloud service provider, often to a simple Virtual Private Server (VPS). None of the scalability and elasticity of the new infrastructure is leveraged, and this is essentially virtual colocation. Keep in mind that differences in the cloud environment will require attention to some areas such as network connectivity, authentication, and monitoring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Many of my clients select this option simply due to lack of internal resources or experience rearchitecting applications for a more sophisticated cloud environment. I often help clients design and plan for elasticity, security, and high availability in a cloud infrastructure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;refactor&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refactor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Refactoring involves programmatic changes to software in order to take advantage of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud environments. The most common application changes I make with clients involve application state. Very often, applications will hold client session data in local memory, making it impossible for subsequent requests to visit another server in the environment. This prevents both scalability and availability. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;For large-scale e-commerce applications, these concerns becomes critical, as adding front-end web server instances improves response times, as well as scalability and availability. The business case for this refactoring is clear; minimizing response times improve not only search engine rankings, but also conversion rates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Other refactorings might involve the integration of a Content Distribution Network (CDN), offered by some cloud service providers. Amazon CloudFront, Akamai, EdgeCast, and Limelight are some examples. A CDN will allow applications to serve content, such as static web pages and images, to users with greater performance and reliability. It can also greatly reduce incremental bandwidth usage fees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rebuild&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebuild&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Many legacy applications simply don’t port well to the cloud. I’ve worked with many companies whose custom line-of-business applications are too archaic to move. Some might rely on an unsupported operating system, application framework, or other defunct technology. Others might require integration with other on-premise systems that also don’t easily move to the cloud. These applications are candidates for a wholesale rewrite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenges&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;While a brand new cloud-native system might sound attractive, there are some potential risks and disadvantages to consider. The primary concern here is the additional capital costs involved in rewriting an application from scratch. Sometimes existing application components can be reused, but these are typically limited to business logic, and are usually thrown away in deference to newer technologies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Another risk is vendor lock-in. Choosing cloud-native infrastructure and services will serve you well, but I caution using vendor-proprietary services. I usually recommend open source solutions and services that are available across vendors. This allows an easier migration between cloud service providers, in order to take advantage of future innovations that one provider may not yet offer. Also, given the “here today, gone tomorrow” nature of the industry, selecting technology proprietary to a specific cloud vendor is a risk to consider avoiding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Finally, consider the organizational changes a migration to the cloud may necessitate. For some, this may involve training to acquire new skills. Individual positions may need to be eliminated, as legacy applications are replaced, and their maintenance becomes unnecessary. Some organizations will eliminate entire departments, save perhaps for a minimal support staff, as the on-premise datacenter is obsoleted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-cloud-cio&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cloud CIO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;As the need for on-premise infrastructure management wanes, CIOs will also shift their focus from implementer to vendor manager. This could be a welcome change for many CIOs, who often long for more time to enjoy their role as a business leader and strategist. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;In your role as a business leader, how are you using the cloud to create value?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2015 22:03:49 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/moving-business-applications-to-the-cloud-part-one/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My best clients have been migrating their on-premise line-of-business applications to the cloud, with varying degrees of adoption. In the coming series of articles, I’ll explain some of the business drivers for this transition, high-level technical considerations, and challenges for the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part One: Business Drivers for Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All organizations are under increasing pressure to maximize their return on technology investment. As budgets shift funds from IT to marketing, the IT organization seeks to save costs. Leveraging a cloud provider, as opposed to maintaining on-premise infrastructure, takes advantage of economies of scale to consume more computing power at lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to the cloud allows for investment using operational expenditures (OPEX), rather than capital expenditures (CAPEX). CFOs no longer concern themselves with depreciating assets, and large lump-sum investments in infrastructure. This approach &lt;strong&gt;frees cash&lt;/strong&gt; for investment in other areas of the business, and reduces the footprint of the IT department as a cost center in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my clients are e-commerce companies, and often have to prepare their infrastructure for peaks in traffic. They usually do this by purchasing far more equipment than is needed for typical demand, and often hosting in redundant data centers to mitigate the risk of downtime. Cloud environments allow for &lt;strong&gt;flexible computing power&lt;/strong&gt; that scales on-demand, paying for only what is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security concerns, maintenance, and upgrades account for significant investment in both service agreements and labor. Many cloud infrastructures eliminate or greatly reduce the constant demand for mundane maintenance tasks. Cloud providers with more specialized staff and a greater focus on security can offer CIOs peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite reason to move to the cloud is &lt;strong&gt;speed&lt;/strong&gt;. What used to take weeks or even months to spec out, order, provision, and configure, and can now be done in hours or less. This allows organizations to rapidly respond to changes in market demand, and the organization can better avoid the losing proposition of an on-premise physical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my next installment, I will examine some of the options for moving an on-premise line-of business application to the cloud. Stay tuned&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>When You Need a Technology Advisor</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/when-you-need-a-technology-advisor/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 01 Sep 2015 01:31:37 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/when-you-need-a-technology-advisor/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Whether you’re an established business looking to raise the bar, or a startup delivering new technology to market, you need expert knowledge and experience to advise you. In this article, I’m going to discuss what a technology advisor does, and how you’ll be far better off working with one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who works with a technology advisor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Business owners and technology executives&lt;/strong&gt; need to make quick but informed decisions. Top line revenue growth, and bottom line profit are key drivers. A technology advisor can bring their considerable expertise to bear in supplementing understanding, finding value, and accelerating learning. These business leaders can take advantage of proven approaches to common challenges, and discover value in new ways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Investors&lt;/strong&gt; often call upon a technology advisor when evaluating a new opportunity. These engagements are called technical due diligence. If an investor is going to spend millions to acquire a startup, or take one public, it must be certain of the content it’s buying, and how quickly it can monetize the investment.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Startup founders&lt;/strong&gt;, unlike traditional business owners and investors, have a vision, but often lack the expertise to realize it. A technology advisor can help guide and launch a new venture through both strategic and tactical expertise.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you need a technology advisor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;A technology advisor can help accelerate business growth by applying the following expertise:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Develop business plans, focusing on cost and time estimates for delivering a solution&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Create prototypes to help communicate ideas to investors and business partners&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Help select the appropriate technologies and vendors to realize business goals&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Guide the software development process, ensuring repeatable delivery of high-quality products and features&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Evaluate staffing needs and help source, interview, and select candidates at all levels of the organization&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Improve individual and team performance through training and coaching&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How you’re better off when I’m gone&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;One of the best reasons why startups call me for advice is the tremendous value I provide &lt;strong&gt;without diluting the firm’s equity&lt;/strong&gt;. Many early stage startup founders don’t want a full time CIO or CTO, and will call upon me tactically while preserving the value of their shares.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;I also work with established firms to help select technology delivery partners, both onshore and offshore. I provide an objective assessment of the capabilities and quality of vendors. Entrusting a third party to help grow a business is daunting. Imagine the &lt;strong&gt;cost of making a mistake&lt;/strong&gt;!&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;For individuals, I help accelerate learning and and improve life balance. New ways of thinking, tools, techniques, and processes produce &lt;strong&gt;dramatic results&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Success with Offshore Teams</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/success-with-offshore-teams/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Aug 2015 03:07:02 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/success-with-offshore-teams/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While a steadily growing number of organizations have been moving their resources offshore, it still remains an involved, high-risk decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Most companies consider moving at least some of their workload offshore for cost reduction and “follow the sun” coverage for support staff. I’ve worked with companies of all sizes to integrate offshore teams, and what I’ve found interesting is the common challenges they have. Most notably, they cite while labor costs are lower, product quality decreases, and projects take longer to complete. As a consequence, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;onshore rework&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;to correct offshore defects erodes the cost savings offered by offshoring. Projects take longer to complete, deadlines are missed, and team morale suffers.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pride and Prejudice&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;One client of mine, a publicly traded e-commerce company, engaged a team in India to handle bug fixes and some new development work. The team here in the US thumbed their noses at the idea, steadfast in their prejudice that “those people in India” lacked the skill to do the work. The onshore team viewed the offshore team as a threat to their jobs, and the onshore didn’t participate enthusiastically in the relationship.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;I insisted that the offshore team was not there to steal their jobs, but rather to free them from less interesting work. The onshore team could then focus on higher value projects, where their expensive skills and institutional knowledge of the company could best be capitalized upon. In addition, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;core development&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;was kept onshore, where at least one leader/senior developer was responsible. Without a control like this, it&amp;#8217;s impossible to know if the product you&amp;#8217;re receiving from offshore is of any quality.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Communication Complexity&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;This is the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;number one reason&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;why offshoring will fail. With a team half a world and half a day away, there is little overlap in the teams’ work days in which to share information. Here is where a solid process, and the collaboration tools to enable it are most valuable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Here are some tools and techniques that work for my clients:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Minimize dependencies between onshore and offshore resources. Your expensive onshore resources shouldn’t be blocked while waiting for offshore folks to complete tasks.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Use great collaboration tools. Basecamp for less technical teams, YouTrack or JIRA for project and task management, Snagit or Jing for screen captures, Dropbox or OneDrive for file sharing, and so on. There are nearly limitless choices here.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Treat your offshore resources as if they were local. Ensure they are always included in communications, meetings, or other relevant events. If you act as if they’re conscripted labor, then you will get exactly the kinds of behaviors back that you have induced—transactional, low-quality work with little documentation from a generally unmotivated workforce.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Never let your onshore team refer to your offshore team as “them.” Seriously, it helps.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Choose the right offshore partner&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;When selecting an offshore vendor, seek a partner that understands and adheres to agile practices such as test-driven development and continuous integration testing. The remote team also needs to be managed locally. That is, they need they need a local leader that they report to. This further minimizes communication complexity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get the right people on the bus&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Product Managers at home must understand iterative and progressive development, minimal viable product, and how to prioritize a product backlogs. You want very short sprints (1-2 weeks long) and tight feedback loops. It&amp;#8217;s not about having someone offshore that never makes a single mistake, it&amp;#8217;s that the mistakes must be easily found and quickly fixed. And for that, you need practical use of Agile tools and techniques. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Apply these same tactics both onshore and offshore.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Success, not perfection, is an incremental process. If you stick to these basic assumptions, you should be able to work offshore with great results. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com&#34;&gt;Give me a call&lt;/a&gt;, and I can help you choose what’s best for your team.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Cure for Analysis Paralysis</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/the-cure-for-analysis-paralysis/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 18 Aug 2015 00:59:06 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/the-cure-for-analysis-paralysis/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;I spend a lot of time working with clients on developing their Agile software development processes. These clients are usually CEOs and senior executives who need to deliver better software faster, cheaper, with higher quality and lower risk. Unfortunately, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;risk avoidance&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;can result in delaying critical decision-making. When this risk aversion becomes debilitating, we have Analysis Paralysis.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Effective business leaders have clear plans and take action. However, we are constantly flooded with new ideas, alternatives, and endless potential risks. It’s easy to fall into the Analysis Paralysis trap, and delay decision-making for &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;fear of being wrong&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Many of my clients, before adopting Agile software development methods, were stuck in the &lt;/span&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;waterfall&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;methodology, where every last functional detail of the system under design must be specified before a line of code could be written. The mindset here is to minimize risk by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;knowing everything up front&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;. The problem here is that by the time you’ve documented every last nuance, you’ve missed a deadline, market opportunity, or a competitor beat you to the punch.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;The same logic applies to all strategic decision-making. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Here’s a few thoughts to help you avoid Analysis Paralysis and start getting results:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ask yourself, what’s the worst possible thing that could happen?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;For most of us, we’re not sending a rocket to the moon, or creating life support systems. If you make a mistake, chances are nobody will get hurt.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;YAGNI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Y&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;ou &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;in’t &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;g&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;onna &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;n&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;eed &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;i&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;t. If you’re not sure which option to choose, and you can defer the decision until it becomes critical, do so. By the time you’re forced to make a decision, you probably won’t need what you thought you did.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;80% is Good Enough&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Also referred to as the &lt;sup&gt;80&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;20&lt;/sub&gt; rule, or the Pareto Principle, we see time and time again that the last 20% of effort isn’t worth the time. If you have 80% of the information you need in order to move, you move. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Now&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ignoring Edge Cases&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;These are the little “what ifs” that are at the root of Analysis Paralysis. We find that most of these little “what ifs” never actually happen.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Limit Your Options&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;When faced with seemingly limited choices, features, options, vendors, etc. it’s most effective to identify just a few (five or less) criteria. Don’t weigh, score, and compare every permutation. You’ll be spinning your wheels instead of making inroads.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What’s the cost of NOT making a decision? Remember, we seek success, not perfection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;I help my clients achieve tactical objectives and strategic goals &amp;#8211; &lt;em&gt;successfully&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
