      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fail.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;size-medium wp-image-852 alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fail-300x225.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;fail&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fail-300x225.jpg 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fail-1024x768.jpg 1024w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/fail.jpg 1600w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;With the end of the year fast approaching, my clients are now focusing like a laser what they would like to accomplish in 2016. Many are finalizing their technology strategy, investing in DevOps practices and tools, committing to Agile transformation, and leveraging the Cloud. All these efforts enable my clients to do two things they couldn&amp;#8217;t before: &lt;strong&gt;fail fast and pivot&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What do we mean by fail fast?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When developing new solutions with my clients, we embrace a feedback loop. That is, quickly get something in front of customers, solicit feedback, inspect and adapt, and then decide how to proceed. Most often, we make changes to the product based on customer feedback, but sometimes we terminate a bad idea before more money is spent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, the concept of failure takes on new meaning. With previous non-agile processes, you would create a product over a long period of time and bring it to market fully baked. Then, the market would determine if what you created has value, meets needs, or just plain stinks. Time and money have been needlessly squandered.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a better way&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work with clients to &lt;strong&gt;redefine failure&lt;/strong&gt; as simply an iterative test of assumptions. We embrace the inevitable imperfections in our product, and &lt;strong&gt;pivot&lt;/strong&gt; to meet the market need. We do this early and often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas Edison once said of his mistakes, &amp;#8220;I have not failed 10,000 times. I have not failed once. I have succeeded in proving that those 10,000 ways will not work. When I have eliminated the ways that will not work, I will find the way that will work.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being agile means your product is never done. I&amp;#8217;ve seen countless companies play roulette with ambitious products and initiatives. These efforts either fail to see the light of day, or once launched, crash and burn in the marketplace. Money, morale, and shareholder value go down the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Working this way also allows us to more easily establish cause and effect. Perhaps a product performs poorly in the market because of a usability or design flaw. Maybe it&amp;#8217;s pricing. Or performance. If we make too many changes over too long a period of time, the distance between cause and effect prevents us from responding quickly to feedback. ​&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Save Money While Making Money&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the late 90s and for a while after, I worked for a number of dot-com bubble startups. Absurd valuations, nebulous business models, and venture capital speculation were the name of the game. Companies used other people&amp;#8217;s money to produce products of questionable value, usually without profit. It was clearly unsustainable, which is why nearly all of those companies are gone now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, business owners, executives, investors, and shareholders want to see dividends early and often.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Producing a product iteratively allows us to get revenue much earlier than ever before. We can use this revenue, even if minimal, to fund the development of additional features. We add value, then customers respond with more of their money. Another feedback loop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge Questions for Business Leaders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your process allow you to quickly and easily implement and test new features in the market?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can you quickly isolate which feature changes contribute to success and failure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How fast can you incorporate customer feedback into your next release?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Are you Elastic Enough for Cyber Monday?</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/are-you-elastic-enough-for-cyber-monday/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 02 Nov 2015 17:56:45 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/are-you-elastic-enough-for-cyber-monday/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Imagine a typical week of traffic to your company&amp;#8217;s web store. This pattern might look a lot like your own traffic, with a peak during the middle of the day, and a slowdown in the middle of the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone wp-image-814 size-full&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Provsioned-Capacity.png&#34; alt=&#34;Provsioned Capacity&#34; width=&#34;721&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Provsioned-Capacity-300x94.png 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Provsioned-Capacity.png 721w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 721px) 100vw, 721px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given this pattern, it becomes really easy to do capacity planning. We can provision, say 15% over what we see our normal peak to be, and be happy with the capacity we have for a while, so long as our traffic matches this pattern. But, we&amp;#8217;re in the first week of November. Check out this traffic graph from one of my e-commerce clients from last November:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;alignnone wp-image-817 size-full&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/November-Traffic.png&#34; alt=&#34;November Traffic&#34; width=&#34;722&#34; height=&#34;319&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/November-Traffic-300x133.png 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/November-Traffic.png 722w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 722px) 100vw, 722px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This graphic represents the entire month of November. We can see big growth at the end of the month with Black Friday and Cyber Monday sales. If we stuck with our &amp;#8220;add 15%&amp;#8221; rule of thumb applied to the spikes, we&amp;#8217;d be in deep trouble for the month. That&amp;#8217;s a lot of wasted capacity and cost &amp;#8211; potentially 76% wasted, with only 24% of it on average utilized for the month. Traditionally, this is how IT has done things. You bought servers for a 6-12 month vision for what growth might look like. So, what&amp;#8217;s the solution to all this waste?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Migrating your infrastructure to the cloud enables elasticity and autoscaling, allowing us to map your capacity directly to end-user needs. We can ensure that at any given point in time, only what you need is provisioned, versus an arbitrary guess at capacity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my clients&amp;#8217; web stores was hosted on an outdated infrastructure at the end of its lifecycle. Bandwidth was not optimized and the company recognized that the maintenance costs were no longer sustainable. Furthermore, the old website infrastructure was not scalable, preventing the company from supporting new online initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were able to take advantage of the cloud to quickly design and implement a new architecture that could meet workload demands. As a result, we launched their new web store in less than a month. Infrastructure costs were reduced by 50% with improved performance and scalability. Time to market is now close to zero.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Are you elastic enough for Cyber Monday?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge Questions for Business Leaders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How are you prepared to handle unforeseen spikes in demand?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How much money are you wasting in unused capacity?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How quickly can you launch a new offering with your current infrastructure?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/get-your-head-out-of-the-cloud/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;img class=&#34;alignnone size-full wp-image-786&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Head-In-The-Clouds.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Head-In-The-Clouds&#34; width=&#34;540&#34; height=&#34;382&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Head-In-The-Clouds-300x212.jpg 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Head-In-The-Clouds.jpg 540w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 540px) 100vw, 540px&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Software is a means to an end, not an end in and of itself.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;My long-time client, a general contractor, called me this weekend with a “great idea” for some custom cloud-based software that will transform his business. I get calls like this all the time; these requests usually go something like this:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&#34;ol1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Client is in pain&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Build a new software system&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;No more pain&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Profit!&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;This is &lt;strong&gt;cloudy thinking&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;I asked my client about his real objectives, and he started rattling off requirements for this piece of magic software. The problem with this thinking is that it may give you what you &lt;strong&gt;want&lt;/strong&gt;, but it doesn’t necessarily give you what you &lt;strong&gt;need&lt;/strong&gt;. Most consultants, especially in the software business, will approach these projects as opportunities to rack up endless billable hours to create a brilliant application that &lt;strong&gt;doesn’t do a damn thing&lt;/strong&gt; to help the customer’s real pain.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;We discussed the underlying pain he was suffering. It had nothing to do with inefficient software. &lt;strong&gt;He had too much business!&lt;/strong&gt; He was turning away jobs because he simply didn’t have the personal bandwidth or manpower to scale his operation up.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;He also revealed a secondary goal – to expand nationally. As a local contractor, he can’t possibly take jobs nationwide. How could he be everywhere? He has a strong brand – one we could leverage as a marketing tool.&lt;span class=&#34;Apple-converted-space&#34;&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So we created a plan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Social CRM to the rescue.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;I implemented a cloud-based Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system to manage his growing national referral network, and to ensure consistency in his branding. Through social media and other channels, we advertised him nationally, and referred jobs out to local contractors under his brand, sharing the revenue. The local contractors were free to use whatever software systems they liked, so long as the end customer received reports and other materials using my clients’ branding.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;While I did create some custom software, it was not at all what my client originally envisioned. &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;However, it is what he &lt;strong&gt;needed&lt;/strong&gt;. Software is simply the enabler of a solid business plan. We approached the business plan first, and the implementation details later.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;We started with a request for new software, but followed this line of thinking instead:&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&#34;ol1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Understand the pain&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Define a business objective&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Determine measures of success&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Evaluate the value of the effort&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Implement&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Alleviate pain&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Profit!&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Much better, right?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;I am passionate about building cloud-based systems and leveraging technology to solve business problems. However, it’s ultimately the business problems I help solve which creates the real value, not the tools used to get there.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;Is your head in the cloud?&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&#34;p1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Challenge Questions for Business Leaders&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol class=&#34;ol1&#34;&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;What pain are you suffering, for which you’ve been considering a technology solution?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;What are your longer term strategic goals?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li class=&#34;li1&#34;&gt;
    &lt;span class=&#34;s1&#34;&gt;What have you tried before that didn’t work?&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>What’s your SCAM Strategy for 2016?</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/whats-your-scam-strategy-for-2016/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 12 Oct 2015 14:20:33 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/whats-your-scam-strategy-for-2016/</guid>
      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img class=&#34;wp-image-776 alignleft&#34; src=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SCAM.png&#34; alt=&#34;SCAM&#34; width=&#34;328&#34; height=&#34;314&#34; srcset=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SCAM-52x50.png 52w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SCAM-300x287.png 300w, http://www.markrichman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/SCAM.png 790w&#34; sizes=&#34;(max-width: 328px) 100vw, 328px&#34; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that we’re in Q4, your technology strategy for 2016 should be well formed. So what’s your plan for SCAM? The Social, Cloud, Analytics, and Mobile (SCAM) stack presents a framework in which organizations can align marketing and technical efforts with a customer-centric strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;social-media-is-the-new-crm&#34;&gt;Social Media is the New CRM&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People have an innate need for affiliation. We join clubs, professional associations, play sports, and even practice our religions, to one degree or another, in order to satisfy this need. Social media is the modern extension of this community-building. We friend, tweet, pin, share, and like; we are not only expressing our individuality online, but also identifying with groups and brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s all well and good for sharing cat videos and pictures of your kids, right? &lt;strong&gt;WRONG&lt;/strong&gt;. Social media is a powerful tool to engage your existing customers, and attract new ones, all by capitalizing on their need for affiliation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.noahfleming.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Noah Fleming&lt;/a&gt; writes about community in his book &lt;em&gt;Evergreen&lt;/em&gt;, &amp;#8220;as our customers are becoming more interconnected, they are naturally beginning to build elements of community on their own. Furthermore, if you don&amp;#8217;t create a strong customer community, you can be guaranteed that your competitors will.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traditional Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems are transactional in nature. They collect data on customers, transactions, and contact histories. &lt;strong&gt;Social CRM&lt;/strong&gt; allows companies to directly interact with customers &lt;em&gt;en masse&lt;/em&gt;, observe how they communicate with each other, and gauge sentiment about your company.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Social media isn&amp;#8217;t just for marketers either. Inbound customer service also leverages social media, offering customers a deeper sense of connectedness than an 800 number or a contact form on your website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of my clients is the CEO/Owner of an online vitamin supplement company. We were discussing how his larger competitors engaged with customers using social media. While these companies had a team of customer service folks monitoring social media, and interacting with customers, they were too big for their CEO to respond personally. I suggested this was an opportunity for him to &lt;strong&gt;differentiate&lt;/strong&gt; by being directly accessible by his customers via social media. He quickly discovered that he could more quickly obtain customer information than waiting passively for new sales to come in. Learning his customers’ demographics through social media analytics (more on that later) allowed him to save money on advertising campaigns that targeted the wrong segments. Talking with me on Twitter as &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/mrichman&#34;&gt;@mrichman&lt;/a&gt; instead of promoting at me with an ad goes a long way to building trust and loyalty through transparency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;cloud&#34;&gt;Cloud&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All organizations are under increasing pressure to maximize their return on technology investment. As budgets shift funds from IT to marketing, the IT organization seeks to save costs. Leveraging a cloud provider, as opposed to maintaining on-premise infrastructure, takes advantage of economies of scale to consume more computing power at lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to the cloud allows for investment using operational expenditures (OPEX), rather than capital expenditures (CAPEX). CFOs no longer concern themselves with depreciating assets, and large lump-sum investments in infrastructure. This approach &lt;strong&gt;frees cash&lt;/strong&gt; for investment in other areas of the business, and reduces the footprint of the IT department as a cost center in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my clients are e-commerce companies, and often have to prepare their infrastructure for peaks in traffic. They usually do this by purchasing far more equipment than is needed for typical demand, and often hosting in redundant data centers to mitigate the risk of downtime. Cloud environments allow for &lt;strong&gt;flexible computing power &lt;/strong&gt;that scales on-demand, paying for only what is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security concerns, maintenance, and upgrades account for significant investment in both service agreements and labor. Many cloud infrastructures eliminate or greatly reduce the constant demand for mundane maintenance tasks. Cloud providers with more specialized staff and a greater focus on security can offer CIOs peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite reason to move to the cloud is &lt;strong&gt;speed&lt;/strong&gt;. What used to take weeks or even months to spec out, order, provision, and configure, and can now be done in hours or less. This allows organizations to rapidly respond to changes in market demand, and the organization can better avoid the losing proposition of an on-premise physical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;analytics&#34;&gt;Analytics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2015, “big data” is all the rage. But all the data in the world is useless if it’s not relevant and actionable. That’s where analytics come in. Your data can come from a wide variety of sources, from social media, e-commerce transactions, website traffic, financial reports, and so on. We’re able to do more than just track clicks now. We can infer relationships between customers and our products and services, and make predictions about their behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been working with a number of clients to develop 1:1 marketing programs (also called “one-off” marketing) using historical transaction data. Using analytics tools (often more than one), I look at repeat vs. non-repeat customers, time of day or week, and geographic location in order to segment the customer base. Using this data, we can tailor email campaigns, intercept promotions, and product recommendations to a specific customer’s shopping preferences. Ultimately, this not only increases conversion rates, but also average order value and purchase frequency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;mobile&#34;&gt;Mobile&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your web strategy is not mobile-first, you&amp;#8217;re doing it wrong. Over half of all web searches are now from mobile devices. Optimizing your website for mobility or having a native application can take advantage of your customers&amp;#8217; location and identity, for example, allowing for a more customized experience. Providing mobile-optimized productivity applications to your workforce will also enable them to be more productive. Many users now have three or more mobile devices &amp;#8211; smartphones, tablets, laptops, and even watches. It&amp;#8217;s more important than ever to target these devices as first-class citizens as part of your technology strategy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt;In what ways does your social media and social CRM strategy engage more prospects and customers, and build a community?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How is your enterprise architecture equipped to support SCAM challenges?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can your software development process keep up with the rapidly evolving SCAM landscape?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does your team have the tools, skills, and processes in place to execute your SCAM strategy?&lt;/li&gt;

      <title>The CIO should become the CDO</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/the-cio-should-become-the-cdo/</link>

      <description>

&lt;div&gt;
  The role of CIO as Chief &lt;em&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/em&gt; Officer is becoming increasingly irrelevant. IT budgets have shifted to Marketing. Corporate infrastructure is moving to the cloud. So what&amp;#8217;s left? &lt;strong&gt;Data&lt;/strong&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;enter-the-chief-data-officer&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enter the Chief Data Officer&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Data belongs to the business, not just to IT. The CDO represents these business interests. If the CIO&amp;#8217;s job is simply to keep the lights on, that&amp;#8217;s not something the rest of the business will relate to. If CIOs are to survive, they must evolve, much like the technology for which they have been responsible.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  Business intelligence, data analytics, and the value delivered to the business from SCAM (social, cloud, analytics, mobile) will become the primary driver of strategy. We already see this transformation occurring, and CMOs continue to wrestle away not only dollars, but also organizational ownership of the customer. The CMO becomes the CDO&amp;#8217;s best customer.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;the-cdo-is-a-hybrid-executive&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The CDO is a Hybrid Executive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  The most effective CDO will be a &lt;i&gt;hybrid&lt;/i&gt; executive. Often graduating from a CIO or CTO role, their responsibilities will overlap several disciplines:
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Data Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decision Management&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Digital Transformation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  The CDO is a transformational leader, driving business value by integrating emerging technologies with external marketing and customer facing initiatives with internal processes and applications.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;how-the-cio-can-thrive&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How the CIO can Thrive&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
  The successful CIO will be the one who can take their organization and gear it toward the ability to program infrastructure as code, and serve new application development, driven by social, cloud, analytics, and mobile.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;challenge-questions-for-leaders&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenge Questions for Leaders&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What opportunities do you have for creating and enhancing the business value of data?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What is your strategy for responding to SCAM (social, cloud, analytics, mobile) requirements of the business?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How will you reshape the business to take advantage of data and technology?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

      <title>Amazon’s Outage and your Customers</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/amazons-outage-and-your-customers/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Sep 2015 16:13:03 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/amazons-outage-and-your-customers/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This past Sunday around 6am ET, &lt;a href=&#34;http://aws.amazon.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Amazon Web Services&lt;/a&gt; had a mega outage, affecting millions of customers worldwide. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is Amazon&amp;#8217;s global cloud computing infrastructure business unit. AWS powers many popular websites including Netflix, Pinterest, Expedia, IMDB, Reddit, and more. Many of my own clients rely on AWS services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Multiple AWS systems failed simultaneously: DynamoDB, Cognito, and CloudWatch. The latter, CloudWatch, is Amazon&amp;#8217;s own cloud monitoring platform. So, the system used to monitor their own cloud went offline, unable to alert on its offline status. Everyone assumed things were humming along until applications relying on AWS services began to fail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More and more Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies rely on cloud hosting providers like AWS for their infrastructure. When an outage strikes, it&amp;#8217;s not localized like the power company. The whole world feels it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One popular service in my area is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.shipt.com/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Shipt&lt;/a&gt;, an on-demand grocery delivery service, which uses AWS. Customers were able to place orders, but never received their groceries. Shipt started receiving lots of angry Facebook messages, tweets, and emails. Nobody was manning the phones at 6am on a Sunday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The outage was resolved after several hours, but most end customers were unaware of the root cause of their favorite sites&amp;#8217; downtime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think customers understand that websites can go down. They just don&amp;#8217;t want to be surprised. Sunday&amp;#8217;s event was about lack of information. When you have to Google news sites to see if a website or app is having problems, that&amp;#8217;s a problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;SaaS companies, like the ones affected by AWS&amp;#8217;s outage, are generally powerless to resolve underlying issues with their cloud provider. So, they need to be far more proactive in customer notification when problems arise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#8217;s nothing more embarrassing and trust-killing than finding out from your customers that your website is having problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve implemented many third-party and custom monitoring solutions for my clients. One client, a $400M online retailer, had frequent issues with its infrastructure provider, and I delivered a monitoring solution that would notify the marketing team of outages. They could quickly get in front of the issue by posting a notice on the website of checkout issues, and were on call to respond to social media inquiries. This one change stopped most customer service calls, and rebuilt trust with customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acquiring new customers is far more expensive than keeping existing ones. Online businesses should focus on how proactively they handle outages. The customers will trust you and stick around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What steps are you taking to respond to outages and build trust?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Postscript: As I write this, Skype is offline globally most of the day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving Business Applications to the Cloud – Part Two – Cloud Migration Strategies &amp; Challenges</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/moving-business-applications-to-the-cloud-part-two/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Sep 2015 11:31:11 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/moving-business-applications-to-the-cloud-part-one/&#34;&gt;previous article&lt;/a&gt;, we examined the business drivers for a cloud migration. Next, let’s look at some strategies for success, and some common challenges when moving and IT organization to the cloud. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;There isn’t just one path to the cloud. When planning migrations with my clients, I present a number of proven options, with a focus on not only minimizing downtime, but also a path to growth. Most migration plans fall into one of three categories: Forklift, Refactor, or Rebuild. Let’s dive into each&amp;#8230;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;forklift&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Forklift&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;The forklift strategy is generally the most popular. This is the least complex, as it simply involves copying the existing software as-is to a cloud service provider, often to a simple Virtual Private Server (VPS). None of the scalability and elasticity of the new infrastructure is leveraged, and this is essentially virtual colocation. Keep in mind that differences in the cloud environment will require attention to some areas such as network connectivity, authentication, and monitoring.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Many of my clients select this option simply due to lack of internal resources or experience rearchitecting applications for a more sophisticated cloud environment. I often help clients design and plan for elasticity, security, and high availability in a cloud infrastructure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;refactor&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Refactor&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Refactoring involves programmatic changes to software in order to take advantage of Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) or Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) cloud environments. The most common application changes I make with clients involve application state. Very often, applications will hold client session data in local memory, making it impossible for subsequent requests to visit another server in the environment. This prevents both scalability and availability. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;For large-scale e-commerce applications, these concerns becomes critical, as adding front-end web server instances improves response times, as well as scalability and availability. The business case for this refactoring is clear; minimizing response times improve not only search engine rankings, but also conversion rates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Other refactorings might involve the integration of a Content Distribution Network (CDN), offered by some cloud service providers. Amazon CloudFront, Akamai, EdgeCast, and Limelight are some examples. A CDN will allow applications to serve content, such as static web pages and images, to users with greater performance and reliability. It can also greatly reduce incremental bandwidth usage fees.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;rebuild&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rebuild&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Many legacy applications simply don’t port well to the cloud. I’ve worked with many companies whose custom line-of-business applications are too archaic to move. Some might rely on an unsupported operating system, application framework, or other defunct technology. Others might require integration with other on-premise systems that also don’t easily move to the cloud. These applications are candidates for a wholesale rewrite.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;challenges&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Challenges&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;While a brand new cloud-native system might sound attractive, there are some potential risks and disadvantages to consider. The primary concern here is the additional capital costs involved in rewriting an application from scratch. Sometimes existing application components can be reused, but these are typically limited to business logic, and are usually thrown away in deference to newer technologies. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Another risk is vendor lock-in. Choosing cloud-native infrastructure and services will serve you well, but I caution using vendor-proprietary services. I usually recommend open source solutions and services that are available across vendors. This allows an easier migration between cloud service providers, in order to take advantage of future innovations that one provider may not yet offer. Also, given the “here today, gone tomorrow” nature of the industry, selecting technology proprietary to a specific cloud vendor is a risk to consider avoiding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;Finally, consider the organizational changes a migration to the cloud may necessitate. For some, this may involve training to acquire new skills. Individual positions may need to be eliminated, as legacy applications are replaced, and their maintenance becomes unnecessary. Some organizations will eliminate entire departments, save perhaps for a minimal support staff, as the on-premise datacenter is obsoleted.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-cloud-cio&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Cloud CIO&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;As the need for on-premise infrastructure management wanes, CIOs will also shift their focus from implementer to vendor manager. This could be a welcome change for many CIOs, who often long for more time to enjoy their role as a business leader and strategist. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-weight: 400;&#34;&gt;In your role as a business leader, how are you using the cloud to create value?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Moving Business Applications to the Cloud – Part One</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/moving-business-applications-to-the-cloud-part-one/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Sep 2015 22:03:49 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/moving-business-applications-to-the-cloud-part-one/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;My best clients have been migrating their on-premise line-of-business applications to the cloud, with varying degrees of adoption. In the coming series of articles, I’ll explain some of the business drivers for this transition, high-level technical considerations, and challenges for the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part One: Business Drivers for Change&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All organizations are under increasing pressure to maximize their return on technology investment. As budgets shift funds from IT to marketing, the IT organization seeks to save costs. Leveraging a cloud provider, as opposed to maintaining on-premise infrastructure, takes advantage of economies of scale to consume more computing power at lower costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving to the cloud allows for investment using operational expenditures (OPEX), rather than capital expenditures (CAPEX). CFOs no longer concern themselves with depreciating assets, and large lump-sum investments in infrastructure. This approach &lt;strong&gt;frees cash&lt;/strong&gt; for investment in other areas of the business, and reduces the footprint of the IT department as a cost center in the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of my clients are e-commerce companies, and often have to prepare their infrastructure for peaks in traffic. They usually do this by purchasing far more equipment than is needed for typical demand, and often hosting in redundant data centers to mitigate the risk of downtime. Cloud environments allow for &lt;strong&gt;flexible computing power&lt;/strong&gt; that scales on-demand, paying for only what is required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security concerns, maintenance, and upgrades account for significant investment in both service agreements and labor. Many cloud infrastructures eliminate or greatly reduce the constant demand for mundane maintenance tasks. Cloud providers with more specialized staff and a greater focus on security can offer CIOs peace of mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite reason to move to the cloud is &lt;strong&gt;speed&lt;/strong&gt;. What used to take weeks or even months to spec out, order, provision, and configure, and can now be done in hours or less. This allows organizations to rapidly respond to changes in market demand, and the organization can better avoid the losing proposition of an on-premise physical infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my next installment, I will examine some of the options for moving an on-premise line-of business application to the cloud. Stay tuned&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;
