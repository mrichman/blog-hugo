      <title>Why I Never Bill by the Hour Redux</title>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;Four years ago, I wrote a somewhat &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/why-i-never-bill-by-the-hour/&#34;&gt;controversial article on hourly billing&lt;/a&gt;. Since then, I’ve had countless debates, championing the merits of abandoning hourly billing. I’ve educated the naïve, and changed the minds of the entrenched. This article expands on these concepts, and clarifies many of the salient attributes of &lt;em&gt;Value-Based Fees&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;up-on-my-soapbox&#34;&gt;Up on my Soapbox&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most consultants have historically charged a time-based fee, usually hourly. This is a vestige of the legal and accounting professions, where huge firms like the &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_(audit_firms)&#34;&gt;Big Four&lt;/a&gt; served as the model. As the adage goes, “if you can’t be part of the solution, there’s money to be made in prolonging the problem.” Thusly, many attorneys, accountants and most consultants follow this model because they:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are not thinking on behalf of their clients but on behalf of their expertise (IT, strategic, HR, procurement, etc.), so they always come up with some solution already performed by hundreds of others as if client problems are always the same everywhere&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are not innovative enough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;are thus performing contract labor, becoming commodities performing the same activities any in-house lawyer, financial or other skilled laborer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can’t become wealthy working for someone else or charging by time units &amp;#8211; &lt;strong&gt;period&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;price-aint-value&#34;&gt;Price ain’t Value&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are people in my clients’ firms who think they are somehow going to be cheated if they do not pay by the hour. This is typically driven by the internal finance departments or compliance officers who overrule the business development managers who are eager to engage me and are thrilled with a fixed price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The issue with hourly billing is that you are charging the client for your input and not the &lt;strong&gt;value of your output&lt;/strong&gt;. Your client doesn’t care how many hours you put in, only that you have removed their problem so that they feel the difference, within the elapsed time you agreed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;ethical-relativism&#34;&gt;Ethical Relativism&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hourly billing is inherently &lt;strong&gt;unethical&lt;/strong&gt;. I have been unable to figure out how the consultant’s accepted concepts of conflict of interest can possibly accommodate a system in which the consultant’s economic interests and the client’s are so diametrically opposed. If I bill by the hour, and a task takes me longer to complete, that’s good for me (more money) and bad for the client (more time before relief or satisfaction).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When clients are content to look at hours worked, it is clearly because there is a lack of trust. I’ve had attorneys &lt;em&gt;actually&lt;/em&gt; bill me for discussing their bill with me…in six minute increments, of course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hourly billing therefore acts as an incentive to &lt;strong&gt;do the wrong things&lt;/strong&gt; for your client in order to avoid cheating yourself out of the money the client would gladly pay you for the value you provide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, the main disadvantage of charging for your time is that it’s adversarial; it promotes conflict. The client wants a quick fix and the consultant wants a slow fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;consulting-economics-for-idiots&#34;&gt;Consulting Economics for Idiots&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll find countless advice on formulaic approaches to determining your “ideal hourly rate.” These methods usually involve envisioning some annual income you desire to earn, dividing by 2,000 (the typical number of work hours in a year), and &lt;em&gt;voila&lt;/em&gt;! For example, you wish to earn $120,000/year. Following this formula yields $60/hour. For the consultant, this is not at all realistic, since as a sole proprietor, the consultant usually has to bear the costs of insurance, work space, equipment, and all the time that goes into marketing. This generally leaves the consultant with only about 1,000 hours in which to bill clients per year. Following the above formula again, that $60/hour rate becomes $120/hour. Well, $120/hour may sound great to many consultants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, what happens when the client attempts to negotiate your rate? They all do. So, you prepare for this by inflating your rate to, say, $140/hour and take the tactic of &lt;em&gt;tricking&lt;/em&gt; your client into accepting the lower rate of $120/hour. Again, we wade into the pool of the unethical. Ultimately, you discover that other consultants in the same market are now competing with you on price, advertising rates below yours. You’re now forced to work and bill more hours to meet your desired income goal. Perhaps you get desperate and pad the bill with a few more hours, just because you think you can get away with it. Again, unethical. The only way to survive a price war is to refuse to join in!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now, you have been reduced to a commodity, competing on price. Perhaps you can convince your client that you can deliver more value for $140/hour than someone else can for $120/hour, but why even have that conversation in the first place?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Alan Weiss says,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not claiming that every professional services firm charging hourly rates is this unethical, but some are. It’s a shame that this kind of creativity couldn’t be invested in better service for the client or quicker results, but then, there wouldn’t be as many hours to bill. This is the lunacy of hourly billing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The price to charge should be relative to the value the client tells you they will derive from you doing whatever you do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are no guarantees, of course. No doubt you will make a cursory check of the expected cost of delivering the client’s results in order to ensure it will be highly profitable for you too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;training--skill&#34;&gt;Training &amp;amp; Skill&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your training and skill level has &lt;strong&gt;every&lt;/strong&gt; bearing on your ability to do the work. However, this has &lt;strong&gt;no&lt;/strong&gt; bearing on the amount you should charge except that if you can’t do the work within the desired timeframe you won’t be able to charge anything! The price to charge should be relative to the value the client tells you they will derive from you doing whatever you do. I said that before, right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How long you actually spend doing the work doesn’t matter to the client as long as it’s within their elapsed time requirement. The client wants the result &amp;#8211; End of story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the client gets the result sooner, they have the benefit of its value for longer, so it could be argued that you should be paid more if you finish sooner. Reducing your overheads is for &lt;strong&gt;you&lt;/strong&gt; to take advantage of, not the client.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;clueless-clients--scope-creep&#34;&gt;Clueless Clients &amp;amp; Scope Creep&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Virtually all objections to value-based fees, specifically in IT consulting, center around clients not having a firm grasp of what it is they want. Practitioners of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&#34;&gt;agile software development&lt;/a&gt; espouse “embracing change” through a time-boxed, iterative methodology. This works incredibly effectively for &lt;em&gt;internal&lt;/em&gt; software development teams. For external consultants, it becomes more challenging because the scope of a project becomes less clearly defined from the outset. From another perspective, one might consider this phenomenon to be perpetual &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep&#34;&gt;scope creep&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Scope creep only happens if you let it. If you and the client agree upon a fixed scope &amp;#8211; in writing &amp;#8211; before work starts, it is easy to see whether or not any “Can you just …” work is within the scope and therefore within the fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the scope cannot be fully described, documented and agreed upon at the outset, then a preliminary project to gather the necessary information to allow this needs to happen (and get paid for) first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By telling the customer they can have more if they pay more in the way some suggest is making a rod for your own back! The clients will ask for more and then try to argue that they shouldn’t have to pay for it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having helped them before the outset to see the full value of no longer suffering the pains their problem was is causing, you can set your fixed-price, fixed-scope fee at a level that gives them a huge return on investment and gives you a huge profit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One solution I’ve found for reconciling agile/iterative development with value-based fees is to have the client ascribe a value to a particular &lt;strong&gt;release&lt;/strong&gt;, spanning multiple iterations. The release, after all, is the vehicle by which the ultimate value is delivered!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Clients inevitably hit the consultant with a “surprise”. If the surprise falls within the agreed upon scope of the project, it should be dealt with within the agreed upon price of the project. If it’s beyond the scope of the current project, then it forms the basis of a separate discussion about a separate, separately chargeable project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;conclusion&#34;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve found the biggest problem a consultant will encounter is a client who is unable to articulate value. You have to help the client understand the difference it will make to them and their business if their problem is solved/removed. Only then can they explain it to you so you can understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hourly billing isn’t transparent, it’s unethical. The longer the client waits, the richer the consultant gets (if you consider a couple of hundred bucks “riches”). If you want to be a commodity, bill by the hour and suffer price competition. If you want to be a consultant, bill according to the value of the results you help generate. Helping a client in five minutes is far more valuable than five weeks, so why not believe in yourself and charge for your talent not your time? I’m outta here!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;postscript&#34;&gt;Postscript&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In preparation for publishing this article, I’ve circulated it through my personal network of experts. Several thought-provoking questions arose, so I’d like to summarize them here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;value-based-fees-is-just-a-commission&#34;&gt;Value-Based Fees is Just a Commission&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not a form of &lt;em&gt;sales commission&lt;/em&gt;; it is an agreed upon and considerable proportion paid before you ever start work on the client’s project. This puts the client totally in control of their costs, but it’s not a cost; it’s an investment in their business’s future!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And if you fix their problem very fast, they benefit from the value your fix brings for longer. Billing by the hour, you’d earn less if you were that good! Basing prices on value to be received by the client creates win-win. Both parties best interests are one and the same in this case; both want a great job done within a reasonable elapsed time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;guaranteed-results&#34;&gt;Guaranteed Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes projects go off the rails. Avoid allowing the client to cancel the project &lt;strong&gt;at all costs&lt;/strong&gt;. Postpone, delay, reschedule, or negotiate on payment terms if you must. Do not negotiate your &lt;em&gt;fee&lt;/em&gt; as a concession.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ensure that your work is guaranteed. If you do not meet your clients’ objectives, and cannot meet them after sufficient notification and an attempt to correct the shortcoming(s), you are ethically bound to refund your clients’ full fee. This has been my personal commitment to my clients for over a decade.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;ongoing-service--retainer-fees&#34;&gt;Ongoing Service &amp;amp; Retainer Fees&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frequently in IT consulting, a lot of work is “maintenance” in nature, or even incidental Q&amp;amp;A via email or phone, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the case of an ongoing service you could create a retainer arrangement; a quarterly fee, say, for access to you, not for any maximum amount of work or hours. If the issue can be solved in the space of a short phone call, it’s included! If it involves more than this &amp;#8211; annual accounts for example &amp;#8211; this needs to be a separately chargeable project with a finite scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the ongoing service is regular work &amp;#8211; bookkeeping and salaries for example &amp;#8211; you could establish an annual value and create an annual arrangement payable monthly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;discovery-projects&#34;&gt;Discovery Projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes clients need considerable time to articulate value, and consultants need time to discover just how much work will really be involved to ensure a profitable and successful engagement. Avoid the temptation to bill hourly for this work. Agree upon a reasonable amount of time, for a fixed fee, to work with the client to determine the &lt;em&gt;scope of value&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;scope of work&lt;/em&gt;. Be careful to focus only on the &lt;em&gt;what&lt;/em&gt; and not the &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; of solving the client’s problem. Being intimately involved in the discovery will almost certainly ensure a proposal that’s accepted every time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;double-dipping&#34;&gt;Double-Dipping&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: Isn’t working for multiple clients simultaneously “double dipping?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: No! Since you are not selling time, there is no conflict. Feel free to deliver as much value for as many simultaneous clients as you can comfortably handle without sacrificing quality for them…or quality of life for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Q: My client has two project opportunities. Can I work on both at the same time?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A: As you cannot work on two projects at once for the same client, you then have to agree upon the relative priority of the two. Do you stop one to start the other then resume the first later, or do you start the second when the first is finished?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Thoughts on Value-Based Fees for Agile Software Projects</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a quandary &amp;#8211; we, as value-based IT consultants, aspire to charge value-based fees for our services (how obvious!). We know that doing so requires tight scope control. As such, this often requires a detailed specification. However, this is the very &lt;a title=&#34;Waterfall Model&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waterfall_model&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;waterfall model&lt;/a&gt; that the &lt;a title=&#34;Agile Software Development&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;agile movement&lt;/a&gt; shuns. How do you reconcile &lt;a title=&#34;Scope Creep&#34; href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_creep&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;scope control&lt;/a&gt;, customer satisfaction, and ever-changing requirements with value-based fees? I don&amp;#8217;t think it&amp;#8217;s preferable &amp;#8211; or practical &amp;#8211; to do two week iterations on a value-based fee basis. Just as much as value-based fees benefit the client by not requiring them to make an investment decision every time they wish to engage you, they also may trap the consultant into having a value discussion/negotiation with the client for each iteration. Thoughts?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Questioning the Billable Hour part 3: Seven Industries</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/questioning-the-billable-hour-part-3-seven-industries/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 07 Dec 2009 00:42:11 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/questioning-the-billable-hour-part-3-seven-industries/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation A: Is Faster Service Worth More?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your computer is not working properly. You have tried to understand the problem and find a solution that you can implement yourself. Yet, after trying, you are no closer to a solution, you find the situation aggravating, and you decide that there’s no point in continuing to attempt fixing the problem yourself. Your time and attention are better spent on productive activities and should not be wasted on this computer problem any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computer technician that you call asks a few questions then says to bring the computer in to his shop. He charges $60 per hour and predicts the computer ready in two business days. Once he has the computer, he will diagnose the problem then call you with an estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; As you consider not having your computer on hand for two business days, and the opportunities to use it productively that you must forego, would you be willing to pay more to have it fixed and back in use much sooner?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; If the computer technician ****offered to fix your computer within 24 hours, satisfaction guaranteed, for a fixed fee agreed in advance, how attractive would that be to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation B: Evaluating Your Next Car&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You and your spouse are shopping for a new car. Having visited a few car dealers, conducted research on the web, and spoken to a trusted person at your usual auto-service shop, you and your spouse have narrowed your search to two cars, both of which you have taken on a test drive together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; As you consider the value of each car, do you care how quickly or slowly either car was built, or how much time the manufacturer put into design &amp;amp; engineering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; As you consider the asking prices of the cars, does it matter to you how much time the car salesperson has spent on the sales process with you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation C: the Value of a Salad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a restaurant, you order a supper salad. The menu says that the salad costs $7.99. As usual, you expect the salad to be served to you in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your order reaches the kitchen, the manager finds that the supply of tomatoes has gone too low. She sends somebody out to buy tomatoes so that your salad can include them. The errand runner breaks a sweat to get the tomatoes to the kitchen in time for your salad to be served with the rest of the meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your salad is served with the rest of the meal, and it is billed at $7.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; As you sit at your table waiting for your meal to be served (unaware of the restaurant’s tomato supply) does it matter to you if the kitchen’s supply of tomatoes has gone too low, causing the manager to send somebody out to buy more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; If you knew about the low tomato supply and the decision to send somebody out to buy tomatoes, how would that affect your expectations about the timing of the meal being served or the amount billed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation D: How Much Trust When the Meter is Running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacquie has been self-employed as a graphic designer for four years. She has found that her prospective clients (for example to design new logos and use those logos in designing stationery) typically start the buying process by asking her, “How much?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her first year, Jacquie found this frustrating because she could not answer right away. She needed to learn each client’s needs and expectations before she could provide a reasonable estimate, and her estimates were based on how much of her time would be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, she learned to redirect that question to gauge the scope of each new project. This allowed her to provide reasonable estimates and close sales. Still, from that first question until the client signed her estimate, there was always uncomfortable uncertainty and a sense of risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seemed to be a problem of trust intrinsic to the pricing aspect of the sales process. For example, one prospective client said, “I understand that you’ll show me three logo options with samples of how they’ll look on stationery. I am then supposed to choose and you’ll proceed from there. But what if I don’t like any of them as-is and want you to adjust or mix-and-match before I approve one? Would your fees stay the same?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacquie dreaded this. If the client was not satisfied with her initial work, then she would have to charge more or make less money for her time and effort. Under the circumstances, neither possibility was welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She considered that she would have to improve her skill at developing trust. She also longed for a way to make buying from her easier – especially if she could avoid the tension involved in estimating and hoping to make a decent profit when working for clients whose need for her billable time could exceed their budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; What if Jacquie reviews her process for each type of project to establish a range of cost? This way, somebody interested in a new logo and stationery, for example, could ask, “How much?” and Jacquie could reply, “It would cost between X and Y dollars. Let’s discuss what you’d get.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; What if, in addition to replying as above when asked, “How much?” Jacquie would say, “If we can discuss how important it is to you, then we can fix the fees in advance with a satisfaction guarantee”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation E: Paying for the Solution – Not the Time It Takes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dexter is a management consultant with an accounting firm. He has been advising the owners, directors, and senior managers of various companies long enough that he typically begins formulating solutions to their problems during the initial stage of discovering the problem. Understanding that each situation is unique, Dexter still pays close attention throughout the discovery stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because he always brings to bear his years of experience, and because he has the expertise to “sometimes come up with a $10,000 solution in 10 minutes,” Dexter eschews the billable hour as unfair. Rather, his firm charges fixed fees, established up-front based on the client’s gauge of importance, and includes a satisfaction guarantee. When the scope of any project changes while underway, the fee is adjusted on the same basis – all in writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; Would it still be more fair for Dexter’s firm to charge according to his time spent, with his rate per hour linked to his seniority?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; Should any other professions that apply experience and expertise to solve client problems also consider value-based fees, fixed up-front with a satisfaction guarantee, and accommodate any changes in scope by adjusting the fees?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation F: Fixing the Cost of a Pizza&lt;/strong&gt; ****&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Canada, there is a great number of pizzerias. Even small towns typically have more than one pizza place. Though there are pizza chains, there is also a variety of independent pizzerias across the country. Despite the number and variety, the industry has certain standards for ordering and pricing, anywhere you go, based on size of pizza and number of toppings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Emile considered opening a pizzeria in Morocco, he had the opportunity to consider the Canadian model: standard sizes of pizza, each with its own basic price, then standard pricing for toppings, plus free delivery within a certain radius. Emile analyzed the pizza business and found that toppings do vary in cost to the pizzeria. He also found that, with the overhead to keep a pizza oven at operating temperature, the cost to bake a pizza would vary with size each and number per day. The cost of any one ingredient could also vary over time, as would the price of fuel for a delivery car. These all factored into Emile’s business plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; How important is it to you to know how much a pizza will cost when you order it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; If your pizza order today matches your pizza order from a month ago, do you consider it reasonable for the price to be the same, even if the pizzeria’s costs might have varied?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation G: Original, Custom Newsletters for Standard Prices&lt;/strong&gt; ****&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert was a professional writer, not of screenplays or magazine articles, but of original custom newsletters. Despite his ability as a wordsmith in a range of contexts, the market consistently regarded him as a newsletter specialist and brought that business to him. Robert decided to embrace this reputation. The rationale behind his business model was simple: Give people what they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He developed a business model that would always create original, authentic newsletters – best to maintain a credible connection between his clients and their readers – and in an apparent paradox, make profits charging standardized fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reputation for newsletters that had driven demand for his writing was based on reliably good writing with a degree of original authenticity that made his third-party authorship invisible. He trained and managed a small cohort of writers in his techniques also so that readers would assume the writing to be the issuer’s. Robert also ensured that each newsletter would have a look unique to the issuer. Then, each issue would be laid out with client-approved text and photos by the same person who designed the original template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert paid his writers and designers fixed fees and had them work under a contract that protected the business interests of all parties. Likewise, he charged his clients fixed fees under a purchase agreement that both encouraged decisive collaboration on newsletter contents and allowed the flexibility necessary to make each issue fulfil its potential as a timely reflection of the issuer-reader relationship. His purchase agreement even included a pay-upon-approval satisfaction guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; If you could have original, custom work performed for you by a small team of creative people with the security of fixed fees and a satisfaction guarantee, would you bypass low-cost, off-the-shelf alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; If you were to read a newsletter that seems to be a generic, impersonal product with the name and photo of an individual pasted in, would you consider it worth much more to that individual to issue an original, custom newsletter like those Robert and his team create?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the Author:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glenn Harrington is the Principal Consultant of Articulate Consultants Inc. Since 1996 he has specialized in consulting on authentic key messages as the basis for effective marketing, brand management, and client loyalty.  []&lt;a href=&#34;href&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.articulate.ca/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.articulate.ca/&#34;&gt;http://www.articulate.ca/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/a&gt; []&lt;a href=&#34;href&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[]&lt;a href=&#34;href&#34;&gt;1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Situation A: Is Faster Service Worth More?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your computer is not working properly. You have tried to understand the problem and find a solution that you can implement yourself. Yet, after trying, you are no closer to a solution, you find the situation aggravating, and you decide that there’s no point in continuing to attempt fixing the problem yourself. Your time and attention are better spent on productive activities and should not be wasted on this computer problem any more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The computer technician that you call asks a few questions then says to bring the computer in to his shop. He charges $60 per hour and predicts the computer ready in two business days. Once he has the computer, he will diagnose the problem then call you with an estimate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; As you consider not having your computer on hand for two business days, and the opportunities to use it productively that you must forego, would you be willing to pay more to have it fixed and back in use much sooner?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; If the computer technician ****offered to fix your computer within 24 hours, satisfaction guaranteed, for a fixed fee agreed in advance, how attractive would that be to you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation B: Evaluating Your Next Car&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You and your spouse are shopping for a new car. Having visited a few car dealers, conducted research on the web, and spoken to a trusted person at your usual auto-service shop, you and your spouse have narrowed your search to two cars, both of which you have taken on a test drive together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; As you consider the value of each car, do you care how quickly or slowly either car was built, or how much time the manufacturer put into design &amp;amp; engineering?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; As you consider the asking prices of the cars, does it matter to you how much time the car salesperson has spent on the sales process with you?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation C: the Value of a Salad&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At a restaurant, you order a supper salad. The menu says that the salad costs $7.99. As usual, you expect the salad to be served to you in a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When your order reaches the kitchen, the manager finds that the supply of tomatoes has gone too low. She sends somebody out to buy tomatoes so that your salad can include them. The errand runner breaks a sweat to get the tomatoes to the kitchen in time for your salad to be served with the rest of the meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your salad is served with the rest of the meal, and it is billed at $7.99.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; As you sit at your table waiting for your meal to be served (unaware of the restaurant’s tomato supply) does it matter to you if the kitchen’s supply of tomatoes has gone too low, causing the manager to send somebody out to buy more?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; If you knew about the low tomato supply and the decision to send somebody out to buy tomatoes, how would that affect your expectations about the timing of the meal being served or the amount billed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation D: How Much Trust When the Meter is Running?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacquie has been self-employed as a graphic designer for four years. She has found that her prospective clients (for example to design new logos and use those logos in designing stationery) typically start the buying process by asking her, “How much?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In her first year, Jacquie found this frustrating because she could not answer right away. She needed to learn each client’s needs and expectations before she could provide a reasonable estimate, and her estimates were based on how much of her time would be needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, she learned to redirect that question to gauge the scope of each new project. This allowed her to provide reasonable estimates and close sales. Still, from that first question until the client signed her estimate, there was always uncomfortable uncertainty and a sense of risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There seemed to be a problem of trust intrinsic to the pricing aspect of the sales process. For example, one prospective client said, “I understand that you’ll show me three logo options with samples of how they’ll look on stationery. I am then supposed to choose and you’ll proceed from there. But what if I don’t like any of them as-is and want you to adjust or mix-and-match before I approve one? Would your fees stay the same?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jacquie dreaded this. If the client was not satisfied with her initial work, then she would have to charge more or make less money for her time and effort. Under the circumstances, neither possibility was welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She considered that she would have to improve her skill at developing trust. She also longed for a way to make buying from her easier – especially if she could avoid the tension involved in estimating and hoping to make a decent profit when working for clients whose need for her billable time could exceed their budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; What if Jacquie reviews her process for each type of project to establish a range of cost? This way, somebody interested in a new logo and stationery, for example, could ask, “How much?” and Jacquie could reply, “It would cost between X and Y dollars. Let’s discuss what you’d get.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;****&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; What if, in addition to replying as above when asked, “How much?” Jacquie would say, “If we can discuss how important it is to you, then we can fix the fees in advance with a satisfaction guarantee”?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation E: Paying for the Solution – Not the Time It Takes&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dexter is a management consultant with an accounting firm. He has been advising the owners, directors, and senior managers of various companies long enough that he typically begins formulating solutions to their problems during the initial stage of discovering the problem. Understanding that each situation is unique, Dexter still pays close attention throughout the discovery stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because he always brings to bear his years of experience, and because he has the expertise to “sometimes come up with a $10,000 solution in 10 minutes,” Dexter eschews the billable hour as unfair. Rather, his firm charges fixed fees, established up-front based on the client’s gauge of importance, and includes a satisfaction guarantee. When the scope of any project changes while underway, the fee is adjusted on the same basis – all in writing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; Would it still be more fair for Dexter’s firm to charge according to his time spent, with his rate per hour linked to his seniority?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; Should any other professions that apply experience and expertise to solve client problems also consider value-based fees, fixed up-front with a satisfaction guarantee, and accommodate any changes in scope by adjusting the fees?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation F: Fixing the Cost of a Pizza&lt;/strong&gt; ****&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Canada, there is a great number of pizzerias. Even small towns typically have more than one pizza place. Though there are pizza chains, there is also a variety of independent pizzerias across the country. Despite the number and variety, the industry has certain standards for ordering and pricing, anywhere you go, based on size of pizza and number of toppings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Emile considered opening a pizzeria in Morocco, he had the opportunity to consider the Canadian model: standard sizes of pizza, each with its own basic price, then standard pricing for toppings, plus free delivery within a certain radius. Emile analyzed the pizza business and found that toppings do vary in cost to the pizzeria. He also found that, with the overhead to keep a pizza oven at operating temperature, the cost to bake a pizza would vary with size each and number per day. The cost of any one ingredient could also vary over time, as would the price of fuel for a delivery car. These all factored into Emile’s business plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; How important is it to you to know how much a pizza will cost when you order it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; If your pizza order today matches your pizza order from a month ago, do you consider it reasonable for the price to be the same, even if the pizzeria’s costs might have varied?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Situation G: Original, Custom Newsletters for Standard Prices&lt;/strong&gt; ****&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert was a professional writer, not of screenplays or magazine articles, but of original custom newsletters. Despite his ability as a wordsmith in a range of contexts, the market consistently regarded him as a newsletter specialist and brought that business to him. Robert decided to embrace this reputation. The rationale behind his business model was simple: Give people what they want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He developed a business model that would always create original, authentic newsletters – best to maintain a credible connection between his clients and their readers – and in an apparent paradox, make profits charging standardized fees.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reputation for newsletters that had driven demand for his writing was based on reliably good writing with a degree of original authenticity that made his third-party authorship invisible. He trained and managed a small cohort of writers in his techniques also so that readers would assume the writing to be the issuer’s. Robert also ensured that each newsletter would have a look unique to the issuer. Then, each issue would be laid out with client-approved text and photos by the same person who designed the original template.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robert paid his writers and designers fixed fees and had them work under a contract that protected the business interests of all parties. Likewise, he charged his clients fixed fees under a purchase agreement that both encouraged decisive collaboration on newsletter contents and allowed the flexibility necessary to make each issue fulfil its potential as a timely reflection of the issuer-reader relationship. His purchase agreement even included a pay-upon-approval satisfaction guarantee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q1&lt;/strong&gt; If you could have original, custom work performed for you by a small team of creative people with the security of fixed fees and a satisfaction guarantee, would you bypass low-cost, off-the-shelf alternatives?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Q2&lt;/strong&gt; If you were to read a newsletter that seems to be a generic, impersonal product with the name and photo of an individual pasted in, would you consider it worth much more to that individual to issue an original, custom newsletter like those Robert and his team create?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reprinted with permission&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;i-qualifying-the-prospect&#34;&gt;I. Qualifying the Prospect&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the process of determining whether the inquiry is appropriate for your business in terms of size, relevance, seriousness, and related factors. In other words, you don’t want to pursue a lead which can’t result in legitimate—and worthwhile—business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do you think we might be a good match?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there budget allocated for this project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How important is this need (on a scale of 1-10)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your timing to accomplish this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who, if anyone, is demanding that this be accomplished?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How soon are you willing to begin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you made a commitment to proceed, or are you still analyzing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are your key decision criteria in choosing a resource?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you tried this before (will this be a continuing endeavor)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is your organization seeking formal proposals for this work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Point: You want to determine whether the potential work is large enough for your involvement, relevant to your expertise, and near enough on the horizon to merit rapid responsiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ii-finding-the-economic-buyer&#34;&gt;II. Finding the Economic Buyer&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The economic buyer is the person who can write a check in return for your value contribution. He or she is the ONLY buyer to be concerned about. Contrary to a great deal of poor advice, the economic buyer is virtually never in human resources, training, meeting planning, or related support areas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Whose budget will support this initiative?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who can immediately approve this project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;To whom will people look for support, approval, and credibility?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who controls the resources required to make this happen?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who has initiated this request?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who will claim responsibility for the results?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who will be seen as the main sponsor and/or champion?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you have to seek anyone else’s approval?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who will accept or reject proposals?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you and I were to shake hands, could I begin tomorrow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Point: The larger the organization, the more the number of economic buyers. They need not be the CEO or owner, but must be able to authorize and produce payment. Committees are never economic buyers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;iii-rebutting-objections&#34;&gt;III. Rebutting Objections&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Obstacles are those terrible things you see when you take your eyes off the goal,” said philosopher Hannah More. Objections are a sign of interest. Turn them around to your benefit. Once you demolish objections, there is no longer a reason not to proceed in a partnership.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions (in responding to an economic buyer’s objections)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why do you feel that way? (Get at the true cause.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If we resolve this, can we then proceed? (Is this the sole objection?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;But isn’t that exactly why you need me? (The reversal approach.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would satisfy you? (Make the buyer answer the objection.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What can we do to overcome that? (Demonstrate joint accountability.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this unique? (Is there precedent for overcoming it?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What’s the consequence? (Is it really serious or merely an annoyance?)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Isn’t that low probability? (Worry about likelihoods, not the remote.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Shall I address that in the proposal? (Let’s focus on value.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why does it even matter in light of the results? (The ROI is the point.)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: Don’t be on the defensive by trying to slay each objection with your sword, or you’ll eventually fall on it. Embrace the buyer in the “solutions,” and demonstrate that some objections are insignificant when compared with benefits (e.g., there will always be some unhappy employees in any change effort).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;iv-establishing-objectives&#34;&gt;IV. Establishing Objectives&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Objectives are the outcomes which represent the client’s desired and improved conditions. They are never inputs (e.g., reports, focus groups, manuals) but rather always outputs (e.g., increased sales, reduced attrition, improved teamwork). Clear objectives prevent “scope creep” and enable a rational engagement and disengagement to take place, resulting in much greater consulting efficiency and profit margins. (Note that items IV, V, and VI—objectives, measures, and value—are the basis of conceptual agreement.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the ideal outcome you’d like to experience?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What results are you trying to accomplish?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What better product/service/customer condition are you seeking?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Why are you seeking to do this (work/project/engagement)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would the operation be different as a result of this work?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would be the return on investment (sales, assets, equity, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would image/repute/credibility be improved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What harm (e.g., stress, dysfunction, turf wars, etc.) would be alleviated?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much would you gain on the competition as a result?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would your value proposition be improved?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: Most buyers know what they want but not necessarily what they need. By pushing the buyer on the end results you are helping to articulate and formalize the client’s perceived benefits, thereby increasing your own value in the process. Without clear objectives you do not have a legitimate project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;v-establishing-metrics&#34;&gt;V. Establishing Metrics&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“Metrics” are measures of progress toward the objectives, which enable you and the client to ascertain the rate and totality of success. They assign proper credit to you and your efforts, and also signify when the project is complete (objectives are met) and it is proper to disengage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will you know we’ve accomplished your intent?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How, specifically, will the operation be different when we’re done?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will you measure this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What indicators will you use to assess our progress?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Who or what will report on our results (against the objectives)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you already have measures in place you intend to apply?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the rate of return (on sales, investment, etc.) that you seek?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will we know the public, employees, and/or customers perceive it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Each time we talk, what standard will tell us we’re progressing?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would you know it if you tripped over it?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: Measures can be subjective, so long as you and the client agree on who is doing the measuring and how. For example, the buyer’s observation that he or she is called upon less to settle “turf” disputes and has fewer complaints from direct reports aimed at colleagues are valid measures for the objective of “improved teamwork.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;vi-assessing-value&#34;&gt;VI. Assessing Value&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Determining the value of the project for the client’s organization is the most critical aspect of conceptual agreement and pre-proposal interaction. That’s because when the buyer stipulates to significant value, the fee is placed in proper perspective (ROI) and is seldom an issue of contention. Conversations with the buyer should always focus on value and never on fee or price.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What will these results mean for your organization?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would you assess the actual return (ROI, ROA, ROS, ROE, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What would be the extent of the improvement (or correction)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How will these results impact the bottom line?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are the annualized savings (first year might be deceptive)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the intangible impact (e.g., on repute, safety, comfort, etc.)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How would you, personally, be better off or better supported?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is the scope of the impact (on customers, employees, vendors)?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How important is this compared to your overall responsibilities?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What if this fails?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: Subjective value (stress alleviated) can be every bit as important as more tangible results (higher sales). Never settle for “Don’t worry, it’s important.” Find out how important, because that will dictate the acceptable fee range.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;vii-determining-the-budget-range&#34;&gt;VII. Determining the Budget Range&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Too much guessing takes place in the absence of a general understanding about how much the prospect intends to invest (prior to understanding the full value proposition). In many cases, the budget is fixed and entirely inappropriate, and in others it represents a better understanding of the ROI than that of the consultant! (Don’t forget, this presupposes you’re talking to an economic buyer.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you arrived at a budget or investment range for this project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are funds allocated, or must they be requested?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What is your expectation of investment required?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;So we don’t waste time, are there parameters to remain within?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Have you done this before, and at what investment level?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What are you able to authorize during this fiscal year?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can I assume that a strong proposition will justify proper expenditure?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How much are you prepared to invest to gain these dramatic results?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;For a dramatic return, will you consider a larger investment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Let’s be frank: What are you willing to spend?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: There is nothing wrong with exceeding the budget expectation if you muster a strong enough value proposition. But don’t even proceed with a proposal if the prospect has a seriously misguided expectation of the investment need, or simply has an inadequate, fixed budget.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;viii-preventing-unforeseen-obstacles&#34;&gt;VIII. Preventing Unforeseen Obstacles&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As comedienne Gilda Radnor used to say, “It’s always something.” Inevitably, it seems, the best laid plains are undermined by objections, occurrences, and serendipity from left field. Fortunately, there are questions to establish some preventive actions against even the unforeseen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there anything we haven’t discussed which could get in the way?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the past, what has occurred to derail potential projects like this?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What haven’t I asked you that I should have about the environment?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What do you estimate the probability is of our going forward?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you surprised by anything I’ve said or that we’ve agreed upon?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;At this point, are you still going to make this decision yourself?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;What, if anything, do you additionally need to hear from me?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is anything likely to change in the organization in the near future?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are you awaiting the results of any other initiatives or decisions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If I get this proposal to you tomorrow, how soon will you decide?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: Make sure that your project isn’t contingent upon other events transpiring (or not transpiring). If the buyer is holding out on you, these questions will make it more difficult to dissemble. Build into your proposal benefits to outweigh the effects of any external factors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;ix-increasing-the-size-of-the-sale&#34;&gt;IX. Increasing the Size of the Sale&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once conceptual agreement is gained, it makes sense to capitalize on the common ground and strive for the largest possible relationship. Most consultants don’t obtain larger contracts because they don’t ask for or suggest them. You can’t possibly lose anything attempting to increase the business at this juncture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you be amenable to my providing a variety of options?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is this the only place (division, department, geography) applicable?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would it be wise to extend this through implementation and oversight?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should we plan to also coach key individuals essential to the project?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you benefit from benchmarking against other firms?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you also like an idea of what a retainer might look like?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Are there others in your position with like needs I should see?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do your subordinates possess the skills to support you appropriately?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Should we run focus groups/other sampling to test employee reactions?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you like me to test customer response at various stages?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: If you don’t ask, you don’t get. Don’t throw everything including the kitchen sink into your proposal in an attempt to justify your fee. Instead, “unbundle” what you’re capable of providing and add them back in at additional fee.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;x-going-for-the-close&#34;&gt;X. Going for the Close&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Home stretch, but not across the finish line. Runners who slow up at the approaching tape lose to someone else with a better late “kick.” Run through the tape at full speed by driving the conversation right through the close of the sale and the check clearing the bank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Questions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If the proposal reflects our last discussions, how soon can we begin?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is it better to start immediately, or wait for the first of the month?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Is there anything at all preventing our working together at this point?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;How rapidly are you prepared to begin once you see the proposal?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;If you get the proposal tomorrow, can I call Friday at 10 for approval?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;While I’m here, should I begin some of the preliminary work today?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Would you like to shake hands and get started, proposal to follow?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do you prefer a corporate check or to wire the funds electronically?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;May I allocate two days early next week to start my interviews?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Can we proceed?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: There is never a better time than when you’re in front of the buyer and he or she is in agreement and excited about the project. Even without a proposal, beginning immediately “pours cement” on the conceptual agreement and greatly diminishes the possibility of being derailed by surprise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;xi-the-most-vital-question&#34;&gt;XI. The Most Vital Question&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the preceding 100 questions are actually based on the reaction to one question which we often fail to ask of the most difficult person of all. And unlike most of the prior inquiries, it’s a simple binary question, with a clear “yes or no” response.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Question&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you believe it yourself?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Key Points: The first sale is always to yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why I Never Bill by the Hour</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/why-i-never-bill-by-the-hour/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 17 Nov 2009 13:22:31 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/why-i-never-bill-by-the-hour/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve been reading my blog for any length of time, you know that I&amp;#8217;m an advocate of &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470275847/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0470275847&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=markrich0a-20&#34;&gt;Value-Based Fees&lt;/a&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=markrich0a-20&amp;#038;l=as2&amp;#038;o=1&amp;#038;a=0470275847&#34; width=&#34;1&#34; height=&#34;1&#34; border=&#34;0&#34; alt=&#34;&#34; style=&#34;border:none !important; margin:0px !important;&#34; /&gt;. In a nutshell, here is the value proposition to the prospective client:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a cap on your investment. You know exactly what is to be spent and there are no surprises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is never a &amp;#8220;meter running.&amp;#8221; You do not have to worry each time my help is requested that I might be here for an hour, a day, or a week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It is unfair to you to place you in the position of making an investment decision every time you may need my help. Otherwise, you&amp;#8217;re trying to determine the impossible: Is this an issue that justifies a $2,000 visit or a $500 phone call. No client should ever be in that position.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your people should feel free to use my assistance and to ask for my help without feeling they have to go to someone for budgetary approval. This only makes them more resistant to sharing their views, and at best delays the flow of important information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I find additional work that was unanticipated but must be performed, I can do it without having to come to you for additional funds. In those instances, legitimate, additional work would otherwise be viewed as self-aggrandizing and an attempt to generate addition hours or days.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you find additional, related work that must be done, you can freely request it without worry about increased costs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The overall, set fee, in relation to the project outcomes to be delivered, is inevitably less of a proportional investment than hourly billing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If conditions change in your organization, you won&amp;#8217;t be in the difficult situation of having to request that the project be completed in less time. The quality approach is assured, since the fee is set and paid.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I decide that additional resources are necessary, there is no cost to you and I can employ additional help as I see fit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is the most uncomplicated way to work together. There will never be a debate about what is billable time (e.g., travel, report writing) or what should be done on site or off site.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;font-size: 0.7em;&#34;&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Determining Value-Based Fees for Software Projects – Part 3</title>
      <link>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/determining-value-based-fees-for-software-projects-part-3/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 23 Aug 2009 16:00:52 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/determining-value-based-fees-for-software-projects-part-3/</guid>
      <description>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    I followed up on David Winch&amp;#8217;s last points with some more of my own:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8220;Now, all I need is a few prospects on whom to practice! But I&amp;#8217;m sure &amp;#8216;how do I find clients?&amp;#8217; is a huge component of your workshop, so I do not presume to receive such a detailed response to that one.
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8220;It is quite obvious to me now that I have been trying to sell not only what I do, but very specifically how I do it (right down to promoting my toolset of choice). I should probably be focusing more, if not entirely, on what I do to improve the client&amp;#8217;s condition. For example, &amp;#8216;improving small businesses through technology&amp;#8217; or some such tag line.&amp;#8221;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    David replied:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m sure &amp;#8216;how do I find clients?&amp;#8217; is a huge component of your workshop&amp;#8221;&lt;br /&gt; &amp;#8220;Actually, if I&amp;#8217;m understanding you correctly to mean &amp;#8216;how do I get enquiries and turn them into appointments and thus opportunities to get new clients&amp;#8217; then no, it isn&amp;#8217;t a component at all! The &amp;#8216;Pricing By Value&amp;#8217; Workshop only covers how to turn appointments into clients!&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Getting enquiries and turning enquiries into appointments are two other workshops which I&amp;#8217;ve run a few times but never had videoed. There&amp;#8217;s a bit of information on these subjects on my website and you could always decide to become one of my Coaching and Mentoring clients to find out more.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Just to add a brief amount more for you, the key to both of these is the ability to articulate what you do, who you do it for, the pains people who need you are suffering, and how fantastic life is for them when you&amp;#8217;ve fixed their problem. This is also known as an elevator pitch! (Trying to anglicise this to «lift pitch» just doesn&amp;#8217;t seem right!). I’ve written a sheet on this subject which you may find useful.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8220;trying to sell not only what I do, but very specifically how I do it &amp;#8230; should probably be focusing more on what I do to improve the client&amp;#8217;s condition&amp;#8221;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m so glad you realise this! You are the expert. That&amp;#8217;s why the client&amp;#8217;s called you in. They don&amp;#8217;t care how you do it, just fix it! Does the heart surgeon have to describe his procedures in detail in order to get asked to perform a triple by-pass?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8220;improving small businesses through technology&amp;#8221;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;You need to be communicating what I call &amp;#8216;Value Outcomes&amp;#8217; and this is a poor example of one! In my blog, last January, I wrote my analysis of value outcomes &amp;#8211; the good and the bad&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    I was back the next day:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8220;Having an online discussion with a colleague of mine. He says &amp;#8216;Value-based billing doesn&amp;#8217;t produce quality either. Consultants are encouraged to do barely enough to meet the spec, and anything else gets the response of, Sorry, that&amp;#8217;s not in the spec, and we&amp;#8217;ll have to go through another round of estimation before we can even think about what to charge for that? If you stick with hourly, you can adjust the spec faster and be more flexible with the client.&amp;#8217;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8220;I can see some value in his claim. Anyone who&amp;#8217;s worked on a software project knows that change is inevitable. How do value-based fees deal with change without requiring everything to be knowable up front?&amp;#8221;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    Again, David was able to pass his ideas on to me:
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8220;Value-based billing doesn&amp;#8217;t produce quality either&amp;#8221;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I agree! Merely trying to introduce a culture of Value-Based Billing doesn&amp;#8217;t create quality. And besides, behaviour creates culture, not the other way around!&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s the way that Value-Based Billing is incorporated into the Sales Conversation and into the relationship that ensures quality, whatever that may mean in each individual case.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;If you believe you are being abundantly rewarded for your efforts, you&amp;#8217;ll go that extra mile to please your client. You&amp;#8217;ll have an incentive to get better at your job, you&amp;#8217;ll be acting in yours and the client&amp;#8217;s best interests, and you&amp;#8217;ll be lining up the next project and the referrals too.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8220;Consultants are encouraged to do barely enough to meet the spec&amp;#8221;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Encouraged by whom? The client sees you&amp;#8217;re an expert amongst experts and that he&amp;#8217;s getting phenomenal value for his bargain investment, so he won&amp;#8217;t encourage it! And you, the Consultant, are getting hugely rewarded, so why do you feel a need to cut effort and &amp;#8216;quality&amp;#8217; to the bare minimum?&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Does the person who asked you the question equate &amp;#8216;value-based billing&amp;#8217; with &amp;#8216;bargain basement prices&amp;#8217;? If they do then I can see why they think this way. But they need educating into the true meaning of the term. Value-based pricing means Win-Win. And Win-Win means huge value return for bargain investment, coupled with hugely profitable reward. Both can and do co-exist if you use these methods.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Unfortunately the expression &amp;#8216;value pricing&amp;#8217; has been hijacked by the &amp;#8216;cheap and cheerful&amp;#8217; brigade, so you need to make sure your meaning is correctly understood when you talk about Pricing By Value and Value-Based Pricing/Billing.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8220;anything else gets the response of, &amp;#8216;Sorry, that&amp;#8217;s not in the spec, and we&amp;#8217;ll have to go through another round of estimation before we can even think about what to charge for that.&#39;&amp;#8221;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Yes! The original project needs specifying, and anything that arises later that&amp;#8217;s not within the spec should be discussed separately as a potential additional chargeable project.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Having said that, you shouldn&amp;#8217;t be discussing highly detailed first projects! As I said to you before, the first thing you suggest might be a research project to develop the detailed spec of the first coding project. You deserve to be paid for this initial investigation, and why not! If the client has already completed this exercise internally or with another consultant, won&amp;#8217;t you in any case want to check their work to date before you commit to what you&amp;#8217;ll do? When you fly your aircraft, do you give it an external visual inspection before you start the engine? I&amp;#8217;m not a pilot but I bet you do. Commercial pilots certainly do it, every time!&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;And of course you need to know about the new problem and the new circumstances before you can start to price the new project. This needs to be completed but, if it&amp;#8217;s closely related to the existing project, this needn&amp;#8217;t take a very long time.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8220;If you stick with hourly, you can adjust the spec faster and be more flexible with the client.&amp;#8221;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Faster than what? More flexible than what? When you&amp;#8217;ve won a few projects on a value-based basis you&amp;#8217;ll be adept at doing all that needs to be done very rapidly.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;In my Workshop I stress that you need to be able to handle the figures in your head, so they have to be simple. In fact I advocate (as does Alan Weiss) that you get to the point of doing it by gut feel and not computation. If you need to &amp;#8216;go away and work out the figures&amp;#8217;, or even use your calculator on the spot, you are screaming &amp;#8216;cost-based and time-based billing&amp;#8217;, so this would be a shot in the foot!&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;As for flexibility, you will know more than most people about all the circumstances surrounding the client&amp;#8217;s problem. Presented with a new requirement, your judgement of what is and isn&amp;#8217;t feasible and sensible will be considerable. Without this insight you&amp;#8217;ll just be reacting with knee-jerks, even if you charge for them. This would be sticking band-aids over symptoms, not addressing underlying diseases! What long-term use is it giving an aspirin to a brain tumour sufferer?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8220;Anyone who&amp;#8217;s worked on a software project knows that change is inevitable&amp;#8221;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;True! As you and the client understand more about the problem and its solution, some ideas will be jettisoned and replaced. What&amp;#8217;s new?&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;If the scope of the project is to reach the end result, and not about the means to that end, it&amp;#8217;s all still within the scope of the project. And if you&amp;#8217;re being paid five times what your hourly-based fee would have been, what do you care if it extends a little? You just don&amp;#8217;t want to allow it to extend ad infinitum, aka scope creep.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &amp;#8220;How do value-based fees deal with change without requiring everything to be knowable up front?&amp;#8221;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;The real interesting one! And I think I&amp;#8217;ve already answered it! If extreme knowledge is needed to price the final project, you need introductory project(s) to discover that extreme knowledge. These can be priced from the knowledge available at the outset.&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Don&amp;#8217;t keep thinking in terms of one huge project! Some of the more complex projects need several stages. As Alan Weiss says when he&amp;#8217;s suggesting giving the client options, un-bundle your catch-all solution and re-bundle the components into different &amp;#8216;value packages&amp;#8217;. Again, on my Workshop, we look at the question of &amp;#8216;How will I be able to think of several &amp;#8216;value packages&amp;#8217;?&amp;#8217;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ve not tried this next approach myself, but it strikes me that if the client is looking for a bid on an enormous project, you could suggest that they break it down into a series of slightly smaller ones. If you&amp;#8217;re worried about not getting the follow-on work, who else has a better relationship and is better placed to get it? I&amp;#8217;d suggest the follow-on work is yours to lose!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    And there&amp;#8217;s still more!
  &lt;/p&gt;
  
  &lt;p&gt;
    &lt;em&gt;If I&amp;#8217;m not careful, I may end up writing another book here&amp;#8230;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

      <title>Determining Value-Based Fees for Software Projects, Part 2</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Part two of my online discussions with David Winch:-&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;While I understand the concept behind value-based fees, I&amp;#8217;m still trying to wrap my head around how to apply them to what I consider highly commoditized services. That is not to say I devalue my own worth, but I do recognize that there is an upper bound to what someone is willing to pay for a service, regardless of ROI &amp;#8211; price elasticity of demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;At what point am I delivering a valuable service, expertise, information, guidance, and coaching, and at what point am I simply laboring to produce a relatively undifferentiated good (i.e. a presentation website)? I tend to think I do much more of the latter, unfortunately. Certainly, I can rattle off a unique value proposition to a prospect, but many will have shopped around before they talk to me and already have an expectation of what they will pay.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;This brings me to my next hurdle. Assuming I have somehow navigated past the prospect&amp;#8217;s early push to hear a price quoted, I find that I get nervous asking for more money than I think is &amp;#8220;fair&amp;#8221; (whatever that means). Is it a lack of self esteem, or a sense of ethics run amok?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;what I consider highly commoditized services&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;It really doesn&amp;#8217;t matter what you consider! The client&amp;#8217;s perception is the only thing that counts!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;You are unique and provide a unique service, so it is only by your own lack of &amp;#8216;Sales Conversation&amp;#8217; skill that a client could be allowed to retain that impression of &amp;#8220;highly commoditized&amp;#8221;. If they do retain it, this just means you haven&amp;#8217;t done your selling job well enough!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;not to say I devalue my own worth&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;It&amp;#8217;s not yours to devalue (although you could blow it completely!), and it&amp;#8217;s not your worth that matters! It&amp;#8217;s the client&amp;#8217;s perception of the worth of having their problem fixed that matters, coupled with your personal value to the client. This is where the &amp;#8216;Value Conversation&amp;#8217; needs to be heading. As I said previously this can take quite a large chunk of your sales conversation, and mustn&amp;#8217;t be truncated.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;there is an upper bound to what someone is willing to pay for a service, regardless of ROI&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;There is an upper bound, but based almost exclusively on ROI! Having enabled the client to articulate for themselves the true value of having their problem fixed, your fee will be seen as an investment on which they expect that return.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;A ROI of 20 to 1 sounds mightily attractive! 10 to 1 is still pretty good. Many consultants say they&amp;#8217;ll make a client at least three times their fee, but I think this is not desperately attractive. Less than 3 to 1 is certainly not a brilliant investment, even though it does make money. We are trying here to get a reaction of &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s a bargain!&amp;#8221;, so go for a high ROI.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;price elasticity of demand&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Re-read Alan Weiss&amp;#8217;s Value-Based Fees &amp;#8211; particularly the &amp;#8216;Supply-and-demand illogic&amp;#8217; section of chapter 2 (in my edition) on &amp;#8221;The lunacy of time-and-materials models&amp;#8217;. Alan explains brilliantly why the economists&amp;#8217; theories that apply to commodity markets don&amp;#8217;t apply to non-commodity markets such as you providing your services. &amp;#8220;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;At what point am I delivering a valuable service etc&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Easy! When the client believes you are!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or &amp;#8220;laboring to produce a relatively undifferentiated good&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Easy again. Only when you allow them to think this way!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I tend to think I do much more of the latter&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;At the risk of sounding repetitive, it&amp;#8217;s not about what you think! It&amp;#8217;s about what the client perceives and believes.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I can rattle off a unique value proposition to a prospect&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Do I sound like Elvis Presley continually saying &amp;#8220;one more time&amp;#8221; to the band? The client is the one who determines value! You have to allow the client sufficient time to reach this conclusion (generally with your guidance via your questions, but certainly not putting words into their mouth) for themselves, so &amp;#8216;rattling off&amp;#8217; is almost by definition not going to work. And your proposition comes almost at the end of the sales conversation &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s where that entire conversation has been heading all along &amp;#8211; it&amp;#8217;s not even at the end of the value conversation. Re-read the rest of &amp;#8216;Value-Based Fees&amp;#8217;!&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;already have an expectation of what they will pay&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;This is natural, but will be based on their perceived remedy to their perceived pain, turned into a commodity, and put out for the world to bid the lowest price for! If you hear &amp;#8220;that&amp;#8217;s too expensive&amp;#8221; this really translates as &amp;#8220;I haven&amp;#8217;t understood enough of the value of having my problem fixed in this way to see this as a bargain investment in order to achieve that return.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&amp;#8220;You need to get them to understand for themselves what is their fundamental problem; their &amp;#8216;underlying disease&amp;#8217; that is causing the &amp;#8216;symptoms&amp;#8217; or pains that they are experiencing. Once they understand, they can articulate it to themselves, and then to you, and then you can understand also!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A useful question is &amp;#8220;What keeps you awake at nights?&amp;#8221; I doubt the answer is lack of a website! Lack of profitable sales, maybe! You have to ask other value seeking questions first though.&amp;#8221;_&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;somehow navigated past the prospect&amp;#8217;s early push to hear a price quoted&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Well done for identifying this one. Client questions about your daily rate are designed (even if subconsciously on the client&amp;#8217;s behalf) to identify you as a supplier of commodities, and thus be suitable material for forcing into a price war.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;There is only one way to get rid of the daily rate question and that is to say &amp;#8220;I don&amp;#8217;t have one!&amp;#8221; And mean it! If you&amp;#8217;re not charging for your time, why do you even need one in your head?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;It would be wrong to leave your answer there however. You need to continue along the lines of &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m quite prepared to quote my fee, at the appropriate time, later, but at the moment I don&amp;#8217;t know enough about your issues to do so. Please can we start/return to talking about the problems that are bugging you right now?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I get nervous asking for more money than I think is &amp;#8220;fair&amp;#8221; (whatever that means)&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Firstly you have to accept that backing winners at odds of 10 to 1, even 20 to 1, is more than &amp;#8216;fair&amp;#8217;! Secondly, everyone gets nervous when they see how they&amp;#8217;ve been undercharging in the past. [They&amp;#8217;ve also been under-delighting, which is why they&amp;#8217;ve been under-charging!]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;I know I was no exception, particularly in moving from &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;ll invoice you at the end of the project&amp;#8221; to &amp;#8220;My standard terms are 50% before I start and 50% after four weeks&amp;#8221;. Stating that my fee was five or ten thousand pounds instead of the two thousand I would have asked previously was less of an issue for me, but all of us have different types of nervousness.&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Is it a lack of self esteem, or a sense of ethics run amok&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Almost certainly it&amp;#8217;s a lack of self confidence! The good news is there are simple techniques for gaining confidence at this.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;As we&amp;#8217;ve implied already, the toughest sell is to yourself. One technique that works for many people is to think of the highest fee you&amp;#8217;ve ever been able to charge, multiply it by five, and then look in the mirror and tell the face you see there &amp;#8220;My fee is x thousand dollars&amp;#8221;. Keep doing this until you can do it with a perfectly straight face and no hint of embarrassment.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Confidence comes from practise, not further contemplation. If you can say it to yourself, you&amp;#8217;ll be fine in front of clients. And it gets easier every time.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;Do the value-based thing properly and effectively you&amp;#8217;re telling the client &amp;#8216;I know a horse that is absolutely guaranteed to win, but you can still place your bet at odds of 20 to 1.&amp;rsquo;&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David concluded by asking me, &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;What is there to be embarrassed about in that?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/2009/08/23/determining-value-based-fees-for-software-projects-part-3/&#34;&gt;Read Part 3 here&amp;#8230;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Determining Value-Based Fees for Software Projects</title>

      <pubDate>Tue, 04 Aug 2009 18:47:16 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>http://www.markrichman.com:1313/determining-value-based-fees-for-software-projects/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;A couple of days ago &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.davidwinch.co.uk/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;David Winch&lt;/a&gt; noticed me talking on Twitter about &amp;#8220;Determining Value-Based Fees for Software Projects&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Specifically I said:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;While I generally agree that Value-Based Fees (&lt;em&gt;a la&lt;/em&gt; Alan Weiss) are the best way to charge and get what you&amp;#8217;re worth as a consultant, I don&amp;#8217;t know how well this approach translates to the software development domain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;How do you determine value to the client without spending inordinate time performing requirements discovery and analysis? How do you manage change requests in a Value-Based fees approach?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This apparently piqued David&amp;#8217;s interest, so he posted a reply:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Software development is one of the key areas to be adopting a Value-Based Pricing approach &amp;#8211; as you indicate following the Alan Weiss/Ron Baker &lt;em&gt;et al&lt;/em&gt; model.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I think you&amp;#8217;ve almost answered your own question here. You DO need to discover a lot of information before you can suggest a Value Based fee but not, I would argue, specifically to do with requirements, and not in a time consuming manner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;There are efficient ways of finding out as much as possible about the client&amp;#8217;s PROBLEM and the circumstances surrounding it. Then you can go through the remaining stages of the &amp;#8216;Sales Conversation&amp;#8217; and present your options (see A Weiss) and then the associated fees &amp;#8211; all in the space of say an hour or two.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m guessing that your &amp;#8216;value (to the client &amp;#8211; not the price tag) package&amp;#8217; options might all start with a research project to work with the client to discover and agree the detailed requirements of a software solution to the problem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Having agreed (in writing) with the client the scope of the &amp;#8216;value package&amp;#8217; they have selected and your FIXED fee, any &amp;#8216;Change Requests&amp;#8217; can be simply dealt with.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;If it&amp;#8217;s within the scope of the project, it gets done for no additional fee! If it isn&amp;#8217;t, then this is a separate chargeable project! You will be asking the client if they would like you to stop work on the current project while you complete the new one, or whether they&amp;#8217;d like you to finish the current one first. As Jonathan Stark (another Value Based Pricing disciple, from the software world) points out, you can only run one project with any one client at any one time!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This elicited further questions from me:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;Using the Value-Based approach, how does one deal with the &amp;#8220;we&amp;#8217;re a startup, we can&amp;#8217;t afford that!&amp;#8221; response to a proposal? Often I am asked to design/develop websites for clients, which in my opinion is pretty much commoditized at this point. While the value to the client could be extraordinary, the fact that there is limited price elasticity here is working against me. How do I value-price something that can be had at similar quality for a fraction of the cost?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once more David replied:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;d question &amp;#8216;similar quality&amp;#8217;! You are unique! Only you can deliver your project! I work with a web design colleague and we recently talked to a one-man-band about his first website. We didn&amp;#8217;t ask his budget but I&amp;#8217;d guess a few hundred pounds. After the full &amp;#8216;Value Conversation&amp;#8217; based &amp;#8216;Sales Conversation&amp;#8217; (which took us about 1½ hours) he agreed to a £4,000 fixed fee for an e-commerce site. Having seen what it would mean to him to have a website that sells, he found a way of getting the money to invest in the enormous return, and paid 50% up front a fortnight later!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I responded with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;How did you convince him to cough up the equivalent of US$8,000 when he could have easily gone with any number of hosted solutions for under $100/month? I suspect the value conversation took 15 minutes and the sales conversation took the rest?&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David&amp;#8217;s response was to say:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;#8220;The Value Conversation is one of four &amp;#8216;Conversations&amp;#8217; that make up the Sales Conversation, and mostly takes longest of the four. The skill is in helping the client understand for themselves the value of having the problem fixed. In this case we&amp;#8217;ll help him achieve increased gross profits of over £100,000 per year with the new site . There will be additional (chargeable) work involved in driving sufficient traffic to the site, but even so he&amp;#8217;s backing a winner at odds of better than 10 to 1!&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;_&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.markrichman.com/2009/08/09/determining-value-based-fees-for-software-projects-part-2/&#34;&gt;Read Part 2 here&lt;/a&gt;_&lt;em&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
