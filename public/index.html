  Very often, I&#8217;m contacted by prospective clients who are seeking &#8220;help with .&#8221; After some discussion, the truth often surfaces. While clients might want help with a particular technology, what they usually need is completely different. Many of my best clients believed that implementing a popular technology, product, or process will cure all that ails them. In reality, it&#8217;s one of many possible team performance issues that require correction, and not a technology problem.

  What&#8217;s preventing your ability to rapidly innovate? Answer the following: How long does it take you to deliver even a single line of code change into production? How long does it take you to bring a new product to market? How often do you fail to meet commitments to both customers and business partners? Do you want to lower the cost of bringing your products to market? Do you have a deeper backlog of work than you have resources?

  When I was a kid, I loved Mister Rogers&#8217; Neighborhood. My favorite character, aside from Mr. Rogers, of course, was Mr. McFeely, the Speedy Delivery man. Mr. McFeely&#8217;s one and only job was to deliver life lessons in the form of parcels to the neighborhood. When working with my clients, I aspire to be like Mr. McFeely, helping to develop the people, processes, tools, and techniques to enable the speedy delivery of ever evolving solutions to their customers.

  This is a short story about two software development companies. Let&#8217;s call them Alpha and Bravo. Both companies received an RFP (Request for Proposal) to develop custom help desk software. After careful review of the respective proposals, the client selects Alpha for the project. Six months to the day after signing the contract, Alpha delivers exactly what was proposed. However, the client is very unhappy. During the course of development, the client discovered additional features which Alpha failed to include in the final product.

  If you&#8217;re anything like my clients, you spend a lot of time trying to do these two things: Maximize the productivity of your limited staff Maximize the performance of your software systems As your business grows, both problems become increasingly difficult &#8211; and expensive &#8211; to solve. Right now, I want to address the first point &#8211; your team. Extensive research has shown that productivity drains are a direct result of inefficient processes.

  My clients, just like you, want to enable faster, better delivery of value. I&#8217;ve helped these organizations scale and improve their operations through agile delivery, achieving continuous innovation of their products. I write and speak a lot about the people, processes, tools, and technologies required for success with agile. While people and processes are critical for success, I want to switch gears a bit talk about tools and technologies. The pace of application innovation is faster than ever before, requiring Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD).

  For the last few years, especially in the software development space, we&#8217;ve been hearing the word &#8220;agile&#8221; thrown around ad nauseam. Concepts such as iterative design, adaptive planning, collaboration, self-organization, continuous delivery, and so on flood the current literature. I&#8217;ve spent the last several years working with clients to develop and improve their agile practices, improving quality and time-to-market. The result has been great for software teams and customers alike. But aren&#8217;t we leaving the rest of the organization out in the cold?

  Another year in the books. I&#8217;ve had the privilege to help organizations grow, transform, and improve. Along the way, my clients have taught me some valuable lessons that shape how I work. You can&#8217;t stop learning when you view everyone you meet as a teacher. Change is Hard I have worked with a wide variety of client personality types over the years; some are excited, motivated and proactive about change. Others can be insecure, anxious, or apprehensive.

  I&#8217;ve been a sport shooting enthusiast for about 15 years. In that time, I&#8217;ve found the most difficult skill to master is speed vs. accuracy. In a fight for one&#8217;s life, this skill becomes vital &#8211; hitting the right target before you exhaust your ammunition. This same balance applies to IT service delivery. In my consulting work, I&#8217;ve observed clients who have only one speed. Some clients can only deliver quickly, others slowly.

  ​Many of my senior-executive clients have been called upon by their boards to get directly involved in technology issues. These boards are also starting to think strategically about technology, and how industry trends are shaping their companies&#8217; future. More than ever, we need to ask questions that keep us focused on the right issues. While working with clients on new projects, or meeting prospective clients for the first time, I&#8217;ve collected a series of &#8220;must-answer&#8221; questions that bring clarity to any technology strategy initiative.
